For example,
\begin{align*}
&\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,p}(A,B):=(\alpha A^p+(1-\alpha)B^p)^{1/p},
\ \mbox{the quasi-weighted arithmetic mean}, \\
&G_{\alpha,p}(A,B):=(A^p\#_\alpha B^p)^{1/p},
\ \mbox{the quasi-weighted geometric mean}, \\
&R_{\alpha,p}(A,B):=\bigl(B^{{\frac{1-\alpha}{2}}p}A^{\alpha p}B^{{\frac{1-\alpha}{2}}p}\bigr)^{1/p},
\ \mbox{the R\'enyi mean}, \\
&LE_\alpha(A,B):=\exp(\alpha\log A+(1-\alpha)\log B),
\ \mbox{the weighted Log-Euclidean mean},
\end{align*}
where $\alpha\in(0,1)$ (or all $\alpha>0$) is the weight parameter and $p>0$ is the parameter of the quasi extension.
For the quasi versions of these weighted matrix means we consider inequalities in different types of orders such as the Loewner order $\le$, the chaotic $\le_{\mathrm{ch}}$ (i.e., $\log X\le \log Y$), the near order $\le_{\mathrm{ne}}$ (i.e., $X\#Y^{-1}\le I$), the entrywise eigenvalue order $\le_\lambda$, the log-majorization $\prec_{\log}$, the weak majorization $\prec_w$, and the order under trace (i.e., $\mathrm{Tr}\,X\le\mathrm{Tr}\,Y$), whose order relations weaken in this writing order.
Our objective is to pursue under which condition of the parameters $\alpha,p,q$ the inequality $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)\triangleleft\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ holds for all positive (semi)definite matrices $A,B$, for any pair $(\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p},\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q})$ from the above quasi-weighted means and for any order $\triangleleft$ mentioned above.
For instance, it is shown that $\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)\le\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ holds for all $A,B\ge0$ if and only if $p=q$ or $1\le p<q$ or $1/2\le p<1\le q$, whereas, for any other weaker order $\triangleleft$, $\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)\triangleleft\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ holds for all $A,B\ge0$ if and only if $p\le q$. When $(\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p},\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q})$ is a pair from the quasi-weighted geometric type means, we are mostly interested in the condition of $\alpha,p,q$ under which the log-majorization $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)\prec_{\log}\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ holds and whether $AB=BA$ follows from the equality case $\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)=\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ in this situation."

When considered as a linear map, it is natural to introduce the relation of ``similarity'', $P^{-1}AP$ (with $P$ invertible), which is a change of basis that allows us to represent the linear map in a simpler form, in particular in the well-known ``Jordan canonical form''. When considering the matrix $A$ as a bilinear form, the natural relation instead is the one of ``congruence'', $P^\top AP$ (with $P$ invertible), which is the suitable change of basis for bilinear forms. Is there a canonical form for such a relation? The answer is yes, and actually some different canonical forms for congruence have been introduced over the years since the 1930's. In this talk I will introduce the most recent one (by Horn and Sergeichuk, 2006), review the history of this and the other canonical forms, and show some applications in the context of my past and current research, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The solution of the equation $AX+X^\top A=0$ and its connection to $\top$-palindromic pencils.
    \item The consistency of the equation $X^\top AX=B$ when $B$ is either symmetric or skew-symmetric.

One of its most famous appearances is arguably in Gaussian elimination for solving linear systems, where a good choice of pivots is crucial for numerical stability. This talk will focus on pivoting in the context of low-dimensional approximation, including column subset selection, discrete empirical interpolation, and various interpolative decompositions, such as the CUR and Cholesky/Nystrom approximations. In all of these cases, a greedy choice of pivots usually works well but there are well-known counterexamples where such a choice leads to poor results. We present a new randomized pivot selection strategy that avoids such unfavorable worst-case performance by using adaptivity in two senses: It adapts to information on the range / co-range of a matrix, and the sampling distribution is updated after each pivot selection. Adaptive randomized pivoting enjoys error guarantees that match, in expectation, the best known existence results. At the same time, it is   simpler and usually cheaper than volume-based techniques, which achieve similar guarantees through volume sampling or iterative local volume maximization. We will illustrate several applications of adaptive randomized pivoting and discuss derandomized variants. This talk is based on joint work with Alice Cortinovis, University of Pisa."

We show specific examples where the analysis of matrix structures, besides providing a better understanding of the original problem, is a fundamental step in designing effective ad hoc solution algorithms.

Two specific issues are considered:  the analysis of random walks on a regular grid in the quarter plane, and the assessment of the centrality of the edges in a graph. Both issues derive from the analysis of relevant real-world problems and are modeled by Markov chains describing random walks on a graph. 

In the first topic, the graph is a regular grid, and the specific features of the problem lead to semi-infinite transition probability matrices with a two-level tridiagonal and almost Toeplitz structure. We show that these matrices live in a suitable infinite-dimensional structured matrix algebra which is also a Banach space with respect to the infinity norm. This fact will be crucial to designing effective fast algorithms for computing the steady-state vector of the associated Markov chain.

In the second topic, the graph is typically a road map of a city or region. Thus, the Toeplitz structure of the associated transition probability matrix is lost. However, the sparsity and band structure of this matrix will allow us to easily compute a centrality measure of the edges defined in terms of Kemeny's constant of the associated Markov chain. The effectiveness of the model and the solution algorithms is tested on the road maps of Pisa and Tuscany.

The task of learning an adequate similarity measure on various feature spaces often involves  graphs with high clustering coefficients.
We investigate the clustering effect in sparse  clustering graphs by examining the structural and spectral  properties as well as the enumeration  of patterns. In addition, we consider random graph models for clustering graphs that can be use to analyze the behavior of complex networks."

In this talk we consider functions that preserve that class of totally nonnegative (positive) matrices. This subject has rightfully received significant attention over the years, including previous studies on characterizing surjective linear preservers and more recent interesting inquiries into various types of entry-wise preservers for this class of matrices. Building upon the basic fact that the class of totally nonnegative (positive) matrices forms a semigroup we highlight some existing work and investigate and report on some recent progress concerning multiplicative maps that preserve this semigroup of positive matrices.

In this talk, I will present a classification of all surjective linear mappings $\mathcal{L}:\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}\to\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ that preserve: (i)~sign regularity and (ii)~sign regularity with a given sign pattern, as well as (iii)~strict versions of these. As a special case of our results, we recover the characterization of linear preservers for the class of square totally positive and totally non-negative matrices (by Berman--Hershkowitz--Johnson in 1985).

Completion is more important for tensors than for matrices for several reasons. Higher-order datasets are larger, increasing the likelihood of missing or unreliable entries. Large-scale data often exhibits low-rank properties (intuitively, not every entry is ``equally important,'' unlike in smaller matrices). Many interesting problems can be framed as instances of low-rank tensor completion, including image and video recovery, collaborative filtering, and quantum state tomography \cite{liu2013tc, gross2010quantum}. Low-rank tensor completion is generally solved via convex optimization techniques. Current theories concerning these methods often study probabilistic recovery guarantees under conditions such as random uniform observations and incoherence requirements \cite{candes2009exact, liu2013tc}. However, if an observation pattern has some structure, more efficient algorithms can be developed by leveraging the structure.\par

Algebraic methods exploit the low-rank structure to design algorithms that rely solely on standard numerical linear algebra (NLA) operations. They are fast and are guaranteed to work under reasonable deterministic conditions on the observation pattern. In this line, a specific type of ``fiber-wise'' observation pattern has been discussed, where some of the fibers of a tensor (along a specific mode) are either fully observed or entirely missing, unlike the usual entry-wise observations. This observation is interesting because it appears in many real-life applications and highlights a key difference between matrices and tensors. While missing fibers (rows or columns) in a matrix make completion underdetermined, higher-order tensors can still be completed even if some fibers are entirely missing along one mode. It has been shown that under reasonable conditions, canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) and multilinear singular value decomposition (MLSVD) of such an incomplete tensor can still be obtained using only standard NLA \cite{mikael2019fibersamp, stijn2023mlsvdfsj}. Note that there is an important difference with the technique of cross or skeleton approximation in the sense that we assume the availability of fibers in one mode only. \par

With the increasing prevalence of big data, the demand for reliable and scalable algorithms has become more pressing. The tensor train (TT) decomposition is stable and can break the curse of dimensionality \cite{oseledets2010tensortrain}. This talk shows how to extend the fiber-wise completion to the TT format. We discuss the deterministic conditions under which the uniqueness of the solution is guaranteed \cite{stijn2023mlsvdfsj, shakir2024ttfw}. Furthermore, we discuss a few interesting applications and briefly highlight the possibility of utilizing this tensor completion framework as a fundamental experimental primitive for efficient quantum state tomography with fewer measurements.

In other words, there exist constants $K>0$ and $0<\xi<1$, independent of matrix size, such that 
$$
[A^{-1}]_{ij}\leq K \xi^{|i-j|}.
$$
Several versions of such bounds are available in the literature. Most of them rely on polynomial approximation of the function $x\rightarrow 1/x$ on a convex subset of $\mathbb{C}$ containing the spectrum of $A$; see for instance the seminal work by Demko, Moss and Smith \cite{DMS84}.

Here we take a different approach, which exploits the quasiseparable structure of $A$ and $A^{-1}$. Based on recently proposed inversion algorithms for banded matrices \cite{BE23}, we develop new decay bounds for inverses of one-sided and two-sided banded matrices, under a hypothesis of strong diagonal dominance. Our bounds are easily computable, do not require spectral information on $A$ and can be advantageous for symmetric indefinite or nonsymmetric matrices.

","Perfect codes have been key subject of study since the emergence of coding theory in the late 1940s, and they continue to garner considerable interest even after more than sixty years. Hamming and Golay codes are well-known perfect codes, and their significance to information theory is widely recognized. A \textit{code} in a graph $X=(V,E)$ is a non-empty subset of $V$. Given an integer $t\geq 1$, the ball with radius $t$ and centre $u \in V$ is defined as $B_t(u, X) := \{v \in V: d(u, v) \leq t\}$, where $d(u,v)$ is the distance in $X$ between $u$ and $v$. A code $C\subseteq V$ is called a \textit{perfect t-error-correcting code} or a \textit{perfect t-code} in $X$ if the balls $B_t(u, X)$ with radius $t$ and centres $u\in C$ form a partition of $V$. In graph theory, $B_t(u, X)$ is called the $t$-neighbourhood of $u$ in $X$, each vertex in $B_t(u, X)$ is said to be \textit{$t$-dominated} by$u$, a perfect $t$-code in $X$ is called a \textit{perfect t-dominating set} of $X$, and a perfect 1-code in $X$ is called an \textit{efficient dominating set} or \textit{independent perfect dominating set}. In this talk, our goal is to highlight the interplay between the perfect 1-codes and the eigenvalues of graphs. In particular, we focus on the spectrum of special classes of graphs such as Cayley graphs and circulant graphs, and characterize a perfect-1-code in such graphs.  
%Note that this vector has $n/2r$ entries $-(2r-1)$ as we need $(2r) |C| = n$ for $C$ being a perfect code. All other entries of this eigenvector are $1$, so the entry-sum is $0$.

We consider reverse-Grassmannians ({revG}'s) and their corresponding permutation matrices.The number of such revG's is $2^n-n$ which includes the only permutation $n(n-1)\cdots 1$ without any ascents (the reverse-diagonal matrix or Hankel diagonal matrix $L_n$). An $n\times n$ $(0,1)$-matrix $A$  with total support  (every 1 of $A$ belongs to a permutationn matrix $P\le A$) is a {\it revG-blocker} provided that there does not exist a revG permutation matrix $P\le A$. Such a revG-blocker must contain at least $n$ 0's.
We determine a Frobenius-K\""onig-type theorem for revG-blockers with exactly $n$ 0's.

Classical approaches for solving linear systems assume that data is readily available and small enough to be stored in memory. However, in the large-scale data setting, data may be so large that only partitions (e.g., single rows/columns of the matrix/tensor) can be utilized at a time. In this presentation, we discuss the advantages and role of randomization in iterative methods for approximating the solution to large-scale linear systems. Time permitting, we will also discuss our recent work on applications to solving systems involving higher-dimensional arrays, or tensors. Unlike previously proposed randomized iterative strategies, such as the tensor randomized Kaczmarz method (row slice method) or the tensor Gauss-Seidel method (column slice method), which are natural extensions of their matrix counterparts, our approach delves into a distinct scenario utilizing frontal slice sketching.

","Many data are naturally represented as multiway arrays or tensors, and as a result, multilinear data analysis tools have revolutionized feature extraction and data compression. Despite the success of tensor-based approaches, fundamental linear algebra properties often break down in higher dimensions. Recent advances in matrix-mimetic tensor algebra in have made it possible to preserve linear algebraic properties and, as a result, to obtain optimal representations of multiway data. Matrix-mimeticity arises from interpreting tensors as t-linear operators, which in turn are parameterized by invertible linear transformations. The choice of transformation is critical to representation quality, and thus far, has been made heuristically. In this talk, we will learn data-dependent, orthogonal transformations by leveraging the optimality of matrix-mimetic representations. In particular, we will exploit the coupling between transformations and optimal tensor representations using variable projection. We will highlight the efficacy of our proposed approach on image compression and reduced order modeling tasks.

Parametric regression risks model misspecification, while nonparametric regression suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) regression provides a flexible alternative, summarizing covariate effects through a few linear combinations without imposing a specific functional form. While SDR methods have been extensively studied, coordinate testing, which assesses the contribution of a set of linear combinations of covariates, has been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we propose a novel method that transforms the coordinate testing problem into a dimension testing problem by applying appropriate residualization. Since dimension tests are well-established, this method allows practitioners to leverage existing inference tools within the SDR framework.

While such transitions are often explored using two-dimensional energy landscapes, the intrinsic complexity of biomolecular conformations frequently renders low-dimensional representations insufficient. Recent advances in reconstruction models have enabled the characterization of structural heterogeneity from cryo-EM images through high-dimensional latent spaces. However, constructing conformational landscapes in these spaces and identifying preferred transition pathways remain major challenges. 

In this study, we propose a novel framework for identifying preferred trajectories within high-dimensional conformational landscapes. Our method formulates the problem as a graph-based search for minimum energy paths, where edge weights are computed from local energy estimates derived from density in high-dimensional space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by accurately identifying transition states in both synthetic and experimental datasets exhibiting continuous conformational changes. To facilitate future research and reproducibility, we provide a modular implementation of our framework at https://github.com/tengyulin/energy\_aware\_pathfinding/.

These accelerators deliver extraordinary throughput by trading off some degree of accuracy, and, to fully utilise their potential, we must rely on low-precision floating-point formats such as binary16, bfloat16, or binary8.
These reduced-precision formats can have a throughput up to two orders of magnitude higher than binary64, but they lack the precision needed for traditional scientific simulations, which require higher accuracy to yield meaningful results.
To integrate GPUs effectively into scientific computing, we must reimagine high-precision computations by strategically applying lower precision whenever feasible.

We consider techniques to solve the general Sylvester equation $AX + XB = C$ in mixed precision.
By revisiting a stationary iteration for linear systems, we derive a new iterative refinement scheme for the quasi-triangular Sylvester equation.
We then leverage this iterative scheme to solve the general Sylvester equation in mixed precision.
The new algorithms compute the Schur decomposition of the matrix coefficients in low precision, use the low-precision Schur factors to obtain an approximate solution to the quasi-triangular equation, and iteratively refine it to obtain a working-precision solution to the quasi-triangular equation.
However, being only orthonormal to low precision, the unitary Schur factors of A and B cannot be used to recover the solution to the original equation.
We propose two effective approaches to address this issue: one is based on re-orthonormalization in the working precision, and the other on explicit inversion of the almost-unitary factors.

In this presentation, we introduce a novel energy functional to measure the volume distortion of such mappings and propose an associated minimization method to obtain volume-preserving parameterizations. Our method is theoretically guaranteed to converge globally and demonstrates improved effectiveness compared to a state-of-the-art method. Finally, we present its application in brain imaging, showcasing its real-world utility."

Such mappings can serve as parameterizations that define a unified coordinate system, which simplifies various image and geometry processing tasks, such as surface registration and blending. In this talk, I will introduce authalic energy minimization for computing area-preserving simplicial mappings and demonstrate its practical utility in geometry processing.

In general, except for the special case of one-dimensional data (i.e., data with a single feature), no exact solution method exists. In the one-dimensional case, efficient methods leverage the fact that the problem can be reformulated as a global optimization task for a symmetric Lipschitz-continuous function, which can be solved using the global optimization algorithm DIRECT.   We propose a method for finding a globally optimal \( k \)-partition in the general case (\( n \)-dimensional data, \( n > 1 \)), extending an approach originally designed for solving Lipschitz global optimization for symmetric functions. Our method integrates a global optimization algorithm with linear constraints and the \( k \)-means algorithm. The global optimization component is used solely to generate a high-quality initial approximation for \( k \)-means.   We evaluated our approach on multiple artificial datasets and several benchmark examples from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient compared to some other methods from the literature. "

Such edge modes are the eigenmodes of the PDE operator for a joint optical structure formed by connecting together two photonic crystals with distinct topological invariants, and the corresponding eigenfrequencies are located in the shared band gap of two individual photonic crystals. This work is concerned with maximizing the shared band gap of two photonic crystals with different topological features in order to increase the bandwidth of the edge modes. We develop a semi-definite optimization framework for the underlying optimal design problem, which enables efficient update of dielectric functions at each time step while respecting symmetry constraints and, when necessary, the constraints on topological invariants. At each iteration, we perform sensitivity analysis 
of the band gap function and the topological invariant constraint function to linearize the optimization problem and solve a convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problem efficiently. Numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm is superior in generating optimized optical structures with robust edge modes.

In an application-oriented manner, it presents theories to significantly improve critical computational performance and thus aims at a fast implementation for impact-angle-constrained interception of agile maneuvering targets. More specifically, regarding the two major computational burdens using SDDRE, we have replaced the burden in numerical applicability checking by a simple, equivalent, and closed-form condition for the entire state space, which is actually the dominant burden as supported by complexity analysis and extensive validations. Notably, the proposed analysis not only complements the early findings of applicability guarantee in literature, but also promotes the efficiency of the proposed philosophy when compared to the classic method, where the latter has caused concerns/reservations due to its feasibility and difficulty. On the other hand, we have largely mitigated the second major burden of SDDRE by -- after exhaustive trials -- selecting the most efficient Riccati-equation solver until the latest benchmarks. Such evaluations are: 1) in favor of a much-less-known achievement, rather than the common QR-based benchmark and 2) subject to both numerical and hardware experiments including, notably, implementations on microcontrollers and field-programmable gate arrays.

However, it has faced two major challenges -- high computational complexity and parameter tuning. Since its introduction, much effort has been devoted to improving the scalability of spectral clustering, while little research has been conducted on parameter tuning. In this talk, we address the parameter tuning challenge of spectral clustering in a general context. Specifically, we propose two new criteria for tuning the scale parameter used in similarity functions such as Gaussian and cosine. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these tuning techniques. "

and Hinton, 2008) has gained popularity for data exploration, particularly for its highly effective visualization of high-dimensional data, offering valuable insights before analysis. However, with a computational complexity of $O(n^2)$, its applicability to large datasets is limited. In practical applications, the Barnes-Hut $t$-SNE  (BH $t$-SNE, Maaten, 2014), a $t$-SNE variant with computational complexity $O(n\log n)$, is commonly employed for large datasets due to its high computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a divide-and-conquer approach that further reduces the computational complexity to $O(n)$, significantly lowering both computational time and memory usage by processing only subsets of the data at a time. Implementing the divide-and-conquer approach requires careful parameter adjustments to ensure asymptotic equivalence to the original $t$-SNE. We provide theoretical proof of this convergence and support our findings with simulation studies on the MNIST dataset. In summary, this work offers a scalable solution for applying $t$-SNE to extremely large datasets, maintaining its consistency and efficiency.

The weighted spectral geometric mean was defined in \cite{Lee1} by
\[A{{{\rm sp}}_{t}}B={{\left( {{A}^{-1}}\sharp B \right)}^{t}}A{{\left( {{A}^{-1}}\sharp B \right)}^{t}},\quad (0\leq t\leq 1).\]
Operator inequalities between the weighted spectral geometric mean $A{\rm sp}_t B$ and the weighted geometric mean $A\sharp_tB$ have compared in \cite{MFS2023} with the generalized Kantorovich constant for $0<m<M$ and $t\in \mathbb{R}$:
\[K\left( m,M,t \right)=\frac{\left(m{{M}^{t}}-M{{m}^{t}}\right)}{\left( t-1 \right)\left( M-m \right)}{{\left( \frac{t-1}{t}\frac{{{M}^{t}}-{{m}^{t}}}{m{{M}^{t}}-M{{m}^{t}}} \right)}^{t}}.\]
	
In this talk, we consider the case $t\notin (0,1)$. We firstly state the relations of $A\hat\sharp_t B$ and $A{{\hat{\rm sp}}_{t}}B$ for $t\notin (0,1)$ in L\""{o}wner order with the generalized Kantorovich constant. Norm inequalities are also shown for them.
We also give log--majorization and the bounds for the Tsallis relative entropy as its application.
Our talk is based on the results in \cite{FS2024}.

Furthermore, many dedicated numerical methods have been developed to exploit and preserve the structure of pH systems, e.g. for space- and time-discretization, and model order reduction (MOR).
In our work, we focus on the structure-preserving MOR of linear time-varying (LTV) pH systems. LTV systems appear quite naturally in many applications, e.g. in the linearization of nonlinear systems around non-stationary reference solutions, or when some of the system parameters are time-dependent.
In this talk we introduce a general approach based on (Petrov)-Galerkin projection for the structure-preserving MOR of LTV-pH systems. This includes (but is not limited to) the extension of the effort constraint method to LTV-pH systems. Furthermore, we combine balancing and projection to obtain a reduced model that is guaranteed to be pH. We exhibit numerical experiments to validate our algorithms.

high-fidelity compact models to approximate physical phenomena when explicit
models, such as state-space formulations with access to internal variables, are
not available yet abundant input/output data are.
When deriving models from theoretical principles, the results
typically contain differential structures that lead to certain system
properties.
A common example are dynamical systems with second-order time derivatives
like
\begin{equation*}
  M \ddot{x}(t) + D \dot{x}(t) + K x(t) = B u(t), \quad
  y(t) = C x(t),
\end{equation*}
arising in the modeling of mechanical or electro-mechanical processes.
In this case, data are often available in the frequency domain, where the
systems' input-to-output behavior is described by rational functions
of the form
\begin{equation*}
  H(s) = C (s^{2} M + s D + K)^{-1} B,
\end{equation*}
rather than differential equations.
Classical frequency domain approaches like the Loewner framework, vector
fitting and AAA are available and can be used to learn unstructured
(first-order) models from data.
However, these models in their original formulation do not reflect the
structure-inherited properties.
The key element in the derivation of frequency domain approaches is the
barycentric form of rational functions.
In this work, we present a structured extension of the barycentric form for the
case of mechanical systems.
This structured barycentric form is given by
\begin{equation*}
  \widehat{H}(s) = \left(\sum_{j = 1}^k\frac{h_{j} w_{j}}{(s - \lambda_{j})
    (s - \sigma_{j})} \right) \left/ \left(1 + \sum_{j = 1}^{k}
    \frac{w_{j}}{(s - \lambda_{j})(s - \sigma_{j})}\right)\right.;
\end{equation*}
see~\cite{WernerSWR_GosGW24}.
Building on this structured rational function representation, we develop new
algorithms for learning reduced-order models of mechanical phenomena in the
frequency domain, while enforcing the mechanical system structure in the model
description.

for data driven analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems, with a wide spectrum 
of applications. It can be used for model order reduction, analysis of
latent structures in the dynamics, and e.g. for forecasting and control.  The
theoretical bedrock upon which the more general Extended DMD framework 
is built is the Koopman composition operator.
%
DMD can be described as a data driven Rayleigh-Ritz extraction of spectral information
of a Koopman operator associated with the underlying dynamical system. 
The nonlinear data snapshots are represented using the eigenvectors of the
operator resulting in a modal decomposition KMD (Koopman Mode Decomposition).
This becomes a model order reduction tool that represents the nonlinear dynamics
using selected eigenpairs. It can be used to reveal coherent states and for forecasting. \\
In some cases, a numerically computed compression of the Koopman operator exhibits 
high non-normality, and, as a result, the eigenvectors are highly ill-conditioned and the
KMD becomes numerically unstable.
%
We address this problem and introduce a new theoretical and computational framework for
data driven Koopman mode analysis of nonlinear dynamics. The 
problem of ill-conditioned eigenvectors  is solved using a Koopman-Schur 
decomposition that is entirely 
based on unitary transformations. The analysis in terms of the eigenvectors as 
modes of a Koopman operator  is replaced with a modal decomposition 
in terms of a flag of invariant subspaces that correspond to selected eigenvalues. 
  \\
%
The main computational tool from the numerical linear algebra is the partial 
ordered Schur decomposition that provides convenient orthonormal bases for these 
subspaces. \\

In our LAA paper, we studied the matrix equation of Legendre pairs and its properties, focusing on the spectra of the matrices involved, utilizing Gershgorin circles. Legendre pairs are characterized by two invariants related to the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. We propose a low-complexity fast Fourier transform (FFT)-like algorithm to compute the product of the DFT matrix with each sequence of the Legendre pair. By utilizing the FFT-like algorithm, we present a low-time complexity algorithm to search for Legendre pairs. We present numerical results from our C implementation of the FFT-like algorithm, which offers a lower time complexity for finding Legendre pairs compared to traditional combinatorial algorithms.

In this talk, we propose a neural network approach to update the states of dynamical systems through a structured operator known as a Hankel operator -- an operator characterized by a Hankel structure. Our goal is to develop an optimal, low-complexity learning algorithm that utilizes time-delay measurements to forecast future states effectively. By the conclusion of the talk, we will demonstrate how this operator can be employed to model state-space dynamical systems, enabling predictions and insights into future dynamics compared to conventional techniques: SINDy and HAVOK followed by the feedforward neural networks.

A common characteristic of many ``real-world'' graphs is a degree distribution that follows an inverse power law. Specifically, the number of vertices with degree $x$ is proportional to $x^\beta$, where $\beta$ typically ranges between 1 and 3. The Chung-Lu model offers a straightforward approach to capturing this power-law behavior in synthetic networks.

We extend the Chung-Lu model to random geometric graphs. In this extension, each vertex is assigned both an expected degree and a random position in Euclidean space according to a probability distribution. Once the vertices are placed, the realization of each edge occurs independently of others. We rigorously establish the conditions necessary to ensure that the assigned degrees align with the expected degrees. This geometric Chung-Lu model is tested on the connectome of the \emph{Drosophila} medulla (fruit fly), where the random model successfully replicates the graph-theoretical structure of the original network, including the eigenvalues of various graph-theoretic matrices.

The Alternating Anderson--Richardson (AAR) method is also a Jacobian-free method for solving linear systems.

We then apply LAD to address the automatic sleep stage annotation problem using two electroencephalogram channels, demonstrating its efficacy in practical applications.

The geometric structure space $\mathfrak{S}(X)$ of a Banach space $X$ reflects the geometric features of the unit ball $B_X$ of $X$, and is equipped with a closure operator which does not necessarily induce a topology. There is a natural notion of homeomorphisms between (generalized) closure spaces. Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$ are said to have homeomorphic geometric structure spaces, denoted by $X\sim_\mathfrak{S} Y$, if there exists a homeomorphism between $\mathfrak{S} (X)$ and $\mathfrak{S} (Y)$. The classification of Banach spaces with respect to $\sim_\mathfrak{S}$ is strictly coarser (and hence, the results are stronger) than that with respect to the Birkhoff-James equivalence $\sim_{BJ}$.

The purpose of this talk is to present a recent progress on the theory of geometric structure spaces of $C^*$-algebras. In particular, a description of homeomorphisms between the normal parts of geometric structure spaces of $C^*$-algebras acting irreducibly on Hilbert spaces is given.

The second algorithm can instead address large-scale problems by relying on state-of-the-art projection techniques based on the extended Krylov subspace. We test the new algorithms on several problems arising in studying damped vibrational systems and analyzing output synchronization problems for multi-agent systems.

or a reciprocal matrix if it is positive and $a_{ij}=\frac{1}{%
a_{ji}},$ for all $i,j=1,\ldots ,n.$ If, in addition, $a_{ik}a_{kj}=a_{ij}$ for
all $i,j,k,$ the matrix is said to be consistent. Such a matrix is of the
form $ww^{(-T)}$ for some positive vector $w$, in which $w^{(-T)}$ is the transpose of the entrywise
inverse of $w$.

PC matrices play an important role in decision making, namely in models for ranking
alternatives, as the Analytic Hierarchy Process,  proposed by Saaty (1977). 
In these models, a PC matrix represents independent, pairwise, ratio
comparisons among $n$ alternatives and a cardinal ranking vector should be
obtained from it. The consistent matrix constructed from this vector should
be a good approximation of the PC matrix. So, it is desirable to choose a
ranking vector from the set of efficient vectors, as, otherwise, there would
be a positive vector such that the consistent matrix constructed from it
better approximates the PC matrix in at least one entry and is not worse in
all other entries. 

It is known that a positive vector $w$ is efficient for a PC matrix $A$ if
and only if a certain directed graph associated with $A$ and $w$ is strongly
connected. Based on this result, here we give a description of the set of
efficient vectors for a PC matrix as a union of a finite number of
convex sets and discuss some of its consequences. In particular, tight lower
and upper bound matrices for the consistent matrix constructed from an
efficient vector are given.

In our setting, the matrices \(A_n\) are composed of (block rectangular) Toeplitz blocks defined by rectangular \(s \times t\) matrix-valued generating functions, and can be viewed as a generalization of classical GLT (Generalized Locally Toeplitz) sequences. Under mild assumptions on the block dimensions, the asymptotic distribution of the singular values of the associated matrix sequences is recently known. Moreover, when the singular value symbol is Hermitian, the spectral symbol coincides with the singular value symbol. Starting from the tools used to determine this singular value distribution, we develop a general preconditioning framework to construct simplified block matrices that approximate the original matrices. These simplified matrices offer two key advantages:\\
1. They maintain the same singular value distributions as \(\{A_n\}_{n}\); \\
2. They enable the solution of linear systems in \(\mathcal{O}(n \log n)\) arithmetic operations.\\
In this way, we propose a natural preconditioning strategy for linear systems with coefficient matrix \(A_n\). We provide detailed singular value and spectral analyses of the preconditioned matrix sequences and validate our approach through numerical experiments concerning the convergence of various (preconditioned) Krylov solvers.

However, the real nonsymmetric setting remains less explored due to the challenges associated with analyzing the eigenvalues and, consequently, the convergence behavior of iterative solvers. To address this, we employ a symmetrization technique that permutes the coefficient matrix into a real symmetric Hankel structure, whose eigenvalue distribution is known. Then, by leveraging Generalized Locally Toeplitz (GLT) theory, we develop a novel preconditioning strategy that involves centrosymmetric preconditioners, such as those derived from the $\tau$ algebra. This approach constitutes a general framework, as it relies solely on the generating function of the Toeplitz matrix, provided that it is defined. We extend all theoretical results to both the multilevel and block settings and demonstrate their effectiveness through numerical experiments on space-fractional diffusion equations, providing several examples to critically evaluate the performance of the proposed preconditioners.

The equation under consideration incorporates a Caputo fractional derivative in space and a tempered fractional derivative in time, both of order between 0 and 1. These types of equations are particularly relevant in various applied fields. To numerically approximate the regularized problem, we employ a finite difference scheme, which results in a large-scale two-by-two block linear system. The study presents theoretical insights into the spectral properties of both non-preconditioned and preconditioned matrix sequences, using tools from Toeplitz and Generalized Locally Toeplitz (GLT) theory. Notably, the preconditioner, derived from the GLT framework, is introduced and analyzed here for the first time in this context. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical findings, followed by concluding remarks."

The \emph{triangle number} of the pattern is the largest $k$ such that some $k\times k$ submatrix is (up to permutation) triangular with only $*$ entries on its diagonal.


A \emph{realization} of the pattern over some field is a matrix that can be obtained by replacing each $*$ entry of the pattern with a nonzero value from that field.
The smallest rank of such a realization is the \emph{minimum rank} of the pattern (over that field).  The triangle number provides a natural and simple lower bound on this value.

This talk explores some different combinatorial angles on the triangle number.  For example, we review how the triangle number is connected with the zero forcing number, both for simple graphs and directed graphs.  In fact, the bound it provides on the minimum rank of a pattern is closely related to the bound given by the zero forcing number on the maximum nullity of a graph; we see how, in certain special cases, the relationship is especially strong.  This also motivates the question of Nordhaus-Gaddum type bounds for the triangle number, and we present some recent results on this front.  We also examine the triangle number through the lens of lattice theory and matroid theory, where it provides a lower bound on a related class of minimum rank problems for matroids, one which can provide insights into the original minimum rank problem for matrix patterns.

An important activity in the field of spectral graph theory is the characterization of graphs by their spectrum. Hence, switching provides a tool for disproving the existence of such a characterization. 

In this talk we will overview recent progress on switching methods for the construction of cospectral graphs. Work by Wang and Xu (2010) suggests that most cospectral graphs with cospectral complements can be constructed using regular orthogonal matrices of level 2, which has relevance for Haemers' conjecture. In this direction, we will present two new switching methods based on regular orthogonal matrices of level 2. We will also show a general framework for counting the number of graphs that have a non-isomorphic cospectral graph through any of the existing switching methods for the adjacency matrix, expanding on the work by Haemers and Spence (2004).

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for constructing a nested sequence of homogeneous Riemannian manifolds. Common examples of homogeneous Riemannian manifolds include the spheres, the Stiefel manifolds, and the Grassmann manifolds. In particular, we focus on applying the proposed framework to the Grassmann manifolds, giving rise to the nested Grassmannians (NG). An important application in which Grassmann manifolds are encountered is planar shape analysis. Specifically, each planar (2D) shape can be represented as a point in the complex projective space which is a complex Grassmann manifold. Some salient features of our framework are: (i) it explicitly exploits the geometry of the homogeneous Riemannain manifolds and (ii) the nested lower-dimensional submanifolds need not be geodesic. With the proposed NG structure, we develop algorithms for the supervised and unsupervised dimensionality reduction problems respectively. The proposed algorithms are compared with PGA via simulation studies and real data experiments and are shown to achieve a higher ratio of expressed variance compared to PGA.

Many classical linear algebra methods and decomposition can be recovered in the $\star$-algebra. The recovered methods are a time-dependent version of the original ones. For example, the $\star$-Lanczos algorithm \cite{GisPoz} generalizes the (classical) non-Hermitian Lanczos algorithm and extends the well-known connections between matrix moments, and the Lanczos algorithm \cite{GolMeu,PozPraStr} to the time-dependent case.
The relation between the classical Krylov subspace methods and their $\star$-counterparts can be used as a way to compute the solution of ODEs by the $\star$-algebra approach and, vice versa, to analyze classical Krylov subspace methods for time-dependent matrices with possible applications to perturbed matrices.

Despite its widespread use, the core approach of employing polynomial filtering for restarting has remained unchanged over the past two decades.
In this talk, we introduce a novel compression strategy, called Lanczos with compression, as an alternative to restarting.
Unlike restarting, Lanczos with compression sacrifices the Krylov structure but preserves the subsequent Lanczos sequence.
Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the compression introduces only a small error compared to the standard Lanczos method.
Numerical results show that, in terms of matrix-vector products, our approach is never worse and often outperforms the restarting strategy, sometimes by a significant margin.

More generally, the number and relative positions of the nonnegative roots of $p(-x)$ and $q(-x)$ determine the number of roots of $f$ which lie in the left (or right) half-plane. The \emph{Nonnegative Inverse Eigenvalue Problem} (NIEP) asks for a characterisation of those lists of complex numbers which are \emph{realisable} as the spectrum of some (entrywise) nonnegative matrix. An important special case arises when the Perron eigenvalue is the only root of the characteristic polynomial $f$ in the right half-plane, and, in this special case, a complete characterisation was given by Laffey and \v{S}migoc (2006) which employed a rather long and technical argument. By examining the relationship between the roots of $f$ and those of $p$ and $q$ from a simple algorithmic perspective, we give a new---and perhaps more elegant---proof of the Laffey-\v{S}migoc characterisation which provides a deeper insight into the result.

This talk will examine the use of hierarchical rank structure as a regularizing assumption for high-dimensional covariance estimation. Whereas spatial localization assumes that long-range correlations are near-zero, hierarchical rank structure corresponds to the situation where long-range correlations vary more smoothly than short-range ones. We will first examine, from theoretical and empirical circumstances, the conditions under which this assumption is appropriate. We will then present algorithms and experiments which show how to estimate a high-dimensional covariance matrix from limited samples by imposing hierarchical rank structure. Covariance matrices associated with turbulent fluid dynamics, numerical weather prediction models, and Lorenz-type systems will serve as illustrative examples throughout.

discussing several new constraints on signs 
beyond the well-known signature constraint (1),
clarifying the dichotomy between even and odd degrees 
in the characterization,
as well as describing an underlying group of symmetries 
on the collection of all sign sequences 
that sheds light on the characterization question. 
In addition,
this characterization of realizable sign sequences enables a complete solution 
of the inverse problem for Hermitian matrix polynomials of all degrees, 
albeit only in the generic scenario when all eigenvalues are simple.

I will define the concept of an invertible basis and link it to the Main Theorem in the famous paper [G. D. Forney Jr., SIAM J. Control 13, 493-520, 1975]. When the underlying ring $R$ is an elementary divisor domain, the submodules that have an invertible basis are precisely the free pure submodules of $R^n$. As an application, I will consider the ring $\mathcal{A}$ of functions that are analytic on $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{C}$, where $\Omega$ is either a connected compact set or a connected open set. I will show that, for all matrices $M \in \mathcal{A}^{m \times n}$, $\ker M \cap \mathcal{A}^n$ is a free $\mathcal{A}$-module that admits an invertible basis, or equivalently a basis that is full rank upon evaluation at every $\lambda \in \Omega$. This provides a tool to define maximal sets of root vectors at $\lambda$, and in particular to meaningfully define eigenvectors also for analytic matrices that do not have full rank.

Hence its eigenvalues occur in pairs $(\lambda, -\bar{\lambda})$ if the matrix is complex and in quadruples, $(\lambda, \bar{\lambda}, -\bar{\lambda},-\lambda)$ if the matrix is real. This pairing breaks down when the eigenvalues are purely imaginary and this can lead to numerical challenges in computational methods used in optimal control.  The distance from a given Hamiltonian matrix $H$ to a nearest Hamiltonian matrix $H + \Delta H$ such that any further arbitrarily small Hamiltonian perturbation to $H + \Delta H$ generically removes all its purely imaginary eigenvalues is called the \emph{distance to bounded realness}. Algorithms for finding an upper bound of this distance have been obtained in the literature. In this talk we will present upper and lower bounds on the distance to \emph{bounded realness} which are often seen to be tight in numerical experiments. In fact in many cases the bounds are seen to be equal. We identify conditions under which the equality holds. In particular, we show that our algorithm computes the distance if the Hamiltonian matrix $H$ has only purely imaginary eigenvalues with the ones of positive type being separated from those of negative type. The key to obtaining the results is to convert the Hamiltonian matrix eigenvalue problem into that of an eigenvalue problem associated with a closely related Hermitian matrix pencil.

In several frameworks, we may be interested in the numerical approximation of a prescribed subset of eigenvectors, possibly coming from a good approximation of part of the eigenspace. This extraction of eigenpairs from a subspace can be done employing a class of methods often called oblique projectors. They consist in solving a different generalized eigenvalue problem $P^TAQv = \lambda P^T B Qv$, for suitable $P,Q\in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and $n<m$. A popular example of oblique projectors is Rayleigh-Ritz. However, it can be observed that this method is not backward stable. The goal of this talk consists in proposing alternative methods within the family of oblique projectors, with the additional property of being backward stable. Moreover, in settings where $m \gg n$, we present a randomized version of this technique, obtained via the solution a sketched version of the generalized eigenvalue problem.

From real life to mathematical challenges,"In signal processing the time-frequency analysis of nonlinear and non-stationary processes, as well as the determination of the unknown number of active sub-signals of a blind-source composite signal are, in general, challenging inverse problem tasks. If we consider data sampled on a sphere, things get even more complicated. This is the reason why just a few techniques have been developed so far to study this kind of data. However, many real-life data are of this nature, like in Geophysics and Physics.

The idea is to extend the Iterative Filtering (IF) algorithm to work on the sphere. IF is a non-stationary signal decomposition method proposed a decade ago [1] to address the problem of extracting time-varying oscillatory components from a non-stationary multicomponent signal. This method proved to be really valuable in many applications, see [2] and references therein, and it was accelerated in what is known as Fast Iterative Filtering (FIF) [3] by leveraging the Toeplitz matrix theory.

In this talk, we introduce the generalization of IF to handle spherical data and show how we can address the question about its convergence [4]. We conclude with some examples of application to geophysical data.

A tree cover of $G$ is a collection of  vertex-disjoint simple trees occurring as induced subgraphs of $G$ that together cover all the vertices of $G$. The tree cover number of $G$, denoted $T(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a tree cover. We give a characterization of connected outerplanar graphs whose tree cover number equals the upper bound of $\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$.  We also present results on tree cover number of graph with girth at least 5. In 2011, [Barioli et al., Minimum semidefinite rank of outerplanar graphs and the tree cover number, {\em Elec. J. Lin. Alg.,} 2011] introduced the tree cover number as a tool for studying the maximum nullity of a family of matrices associated with a graph:  Let $\mathcal{S}_+(G)$ denote the set of real positive semidefinite matrices $A=(a_{ij})$ such that for $i\neq j$, $a_{ij}\neq 0$ if $\{i,j\}\in E$ and $a_{ij}=0$ if $\{i,j\}\notin E$. The positive semidefinite maximum  nullity of $G$, denoted $M_+(G),$ is $\max\{\text{null}(A)|A\in \mathcal{S}_+(G)\}.$ It was conjectured in 2011 that $T(G) \le \mathrm{M}_+(G)$ holds for all graphs, and shown that equality holds when $G$ is outerplanar.  Therefore our bounds on $T(G)$ give bounds on $M_+(G)$ for outerplanar graphs. We show that the conjecture $T(G)\leq M_+(G)$ is true for certain other graph families.

Similarly, the minimum rank problem for a simple graph is to find the smallest
rank of a symmetric matrix whose off-diagonal nonzero entries occur according
to the edges of a given graph.  In each case, a fundamental combinatorial lower
bound exists; for the former, it is the triangle number of the pattern, while
for the latter it is the zero forcing number of the graph.  For a given
zero-nonzero pattern, there exists an associated cobipartite graph.  In
previous work, the minimum rank of the pattern and the maximum nullity of its
associated cobipartite graph were shown to obey a simple relationship; each is
equal to the number of vertices in the graph minus the other.  We show that the
corresponding bounds (that of the triangle number and the zero forcing number)
obey this same relationship.  This forms a connection between the goal of
understanding when the triangle number is equal to the minimum rank of a

","Combinatorial matrix theory has found applications in various fields, particularly in spectral graph theory, which has many connections to areas such as chemistry and network analysis. Some of the well-studied objects in this context include the adjacency matrix, Laplacian matrix, signless Laplacian, and distance matrix. More recently, since 2013 and 2021, the eccentricity and neighborhood matrices, respectively, have garnered significant attention due  to several influential articles. A key aspect of spectral graph theory is identifying graphs that can be characterized by their matrix spectrum. We will present recent developments in the study of eccentricity and neighborhood matrices for special classes of graphs, including products of graphs, regular graphs, and multipartite graphs, among others. 

The eccentricity matrix of a connected graph $G$ is derived from its distance matrix by retaining only the largest nonzero entries in each row and column, setting all other entries to zero. This class of matrix was introduced as an application of graph theory to chemical structures.  It is well known that, unlike the distance and the adjacency matrix, the eccentricity matrix is not irreducible for all connected graphs, making it an important problem to identify classes of graphs for which it is irreducible. In this talk, we  investigate various properties of eccentricity matrix and their spectral characteristics. Expanding the scope, we delve into the irreducibility and spectrum of eccentricity matrix for some well-known families of \textit{distance-regular graphs}. 

The neighborhood matrix $\mathcal{NM}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is a graph matrix obtained by the product of adjacency and the Laplacian matrix and is also defined using the neighborhood sets of vertices of $G$. We show that the neighborhood matrix of a connected graph is irreducible.  We determine the $\mathcal{NM}$-eigenvalues of a complete multipartite graph and find that they are always real and non-positive. Moreover, the $\mathcal{NM}$-energy of a complete multipartite graph is twice the number of edges. Further, we show that no two complete multipartite graphs are $\mathcal{NM}$-cospectral.

$A_{\alpha}(G)=\alpha D(G)+(1-\alpha)A(G)$, where $A(G)$ and $D(G)$
are the adjacency matrix and the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees
of $G$, respectively. The largest eigenvalue of $A_{\alpha}(G)$ is
called the $A_\alpha$-index of $G$. Chang and Tam (2023) have solved
the problem of determining graphs with maximal $A_{\alpha}$-index
over $\mathcal{G}(n,m)$, the class of graphs with $n$ vertices and
$m$ edges, for $\alpha \in [\frac{1}{2},1)$ and $1\le m\le 2n-3$. In
the same paper, they posed the problem of characterizing graphs in
$\mathcal{G}(n,m)$ that maximize the $A_{\alpha}$-index for $0<

that, for any $\alpha\in [0,1)$, the problem of characterizing
graphs with maximal $A_{\alpha}$-index over $\mathcal{G}(n,m)$ with
$m\le n-1$ is equivalent to the problem of characterizing graphs
with maximal $A_{\alpha}$-index over $\mathscr{S}(m)$, the class of
graphs with $m$ edges. In connection with the latter problem, we
pose the following conjecture: Let $m\ge 3$ be a positive integer
and suppose that $m={\binom{d}{2}}+t$ with $0\le t < d$. There exists
a real number $\alpha_0$, $\alpha_0=\frac{1}{2}$ for $m=3$ and
$\alpha_0\in [0,\frac{1}{2})$ for $m\ge 4$, such that for any
$\alpha \in [0,1)$, $C^m_{d+1}$ (replaced by $K_d$, in case $t=0$),
where $C^m_n$ denotes the quasi-complete graph with $n$ vertices and
$m$ edges, or $K_{1,m}$ is the unique connected graph with $m$ edges
that maximize the $A_{\alpha}$-index over $\mathscr{S}(m)$,
depending on whether $\alpha\in [0,\alpha_0)$ or $\alpha\in
(\alpha_0,1)$; when $\alpha = \alpha_0$, there are exactly two
connected graphs that maximize the $A_{\alpha}$-index over
$\mathscr{S}(m)$, namely, $C^m_{d+1}$ (or $K_d$, in case $t=0$) and
$K_{1,m}$. The conjecture is established when $t=0$.

First, we approximate \( -(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \) as the fractional power of a discretized Laplacian using the Matrix Transfer Technique and represent the result in integral form via the Dunford-Taylor integral representation. Various quadrature rules are then explored to approximate the integral, leading to rational approximations of the fractional power operator.  
This approach enables us to construct preconditioners expressed as a sum of \( m \) inverses of shifted Laplacian matrices, where \( m \) depends on the chosen quadrature scheme. For \(\alpha\) close to $2$, it is well known that the Laplacian itself serves as an effective preconditioner with linear computational cost. However, as \(\alpha\) decreases toward 1, its performance deteriorates, requiring more specialized approaches. Using Gauss-Jacobi quadrature, we show that our preconditioner significantly improves performance for \(\alpha\) close to $1$, even with a modest \( m \), while maintaining the same computational complexity as the Laplacian.  
To further enhance efficiency, we investigate the use of exponentially convergent quadrature rules to minimize the number of required inverses while achieving optimal preconditioning performance. Specifically, we examine both sinc and Gauss-Laguerre quadratures and demonstrate that, with appropriate parameter tuning, both approaches outperform the Gauss-Jacobi one, ensuring numerical optimality."

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:lyap}
AX + XA = \boldsymbol{c}\boldsymbol{c}^T,    
\end{equation}
where $A$ is a large-scale symmetric positive-definite matrix and $\boldsymbol{c}$ is a vector. 

The classical Lanczos method consists in building an orthonormal basis $\mathbf{Q}_M$ for the polynomial Krylov subspace
\[ \mathcal{K}_M(A,\boldsymbol{c}) = span(\boldsymbol{c},A\boldsymbol{c}, \dots, A^{M-1}\boldsymbol{c}) \]
and in approximating the solution $X$ with $\mathbf{Q}_MX_M\mathbf{Q}_M^T$, where $X_M$ solves the projected equation
\[ \mathbf{Q}_M^TA\mathbf{Q}_M X_M + X_M\mathbf{Q}_M^TA\mathbf{Q}_M = \| \boldsymbol{c} \|_F^2\boldsymbol{e}_1\boldsymbol{e}_1^T.\]
The Lanczos algorithm often requires a relatively large $M$ to obtain a good approximation of the solution, which can lead to memory issues due to the storage demands of $\mathbf{Q}_M$. Furthermore, the solution $X$ can be well approximated by a low-rank matrix, whose rank is significantly smaller than $M$, i.e. the dimension of the polynomial Krylov subspace. 

An alternative approach is to use a rational Krylov subspace instead of a polynomial one. Using the Zolotarev poles as the poles of the rational Krylov subspace, it is possible to approximate the solution $X$ by a low-rank matrix with the guarantee that the residual has norm smaller than a prescribed quantity [$2$]. The rank of the computed approximate solution is usually close to the numerical rank of the real solution. The main drawback is that this method requires solving multiple shifted linear systems involving the matrix $A$, which is prohibitive if $A$ is large. 

Mimicking the approach in [$3$], our method employs a polynomial Krylov subspace to approximate the solution of \eqref{eqn:lyap} while leveraging rational Krylov subspaces associated with small matrices to compress the Lanczos basis. This method accesses $A$ only through matrix-vector products and requires the storage of only a few vectors from the polynomial Krylov subspace instead of the entire Lanczos basis, producing an approximate solution whose rank is independent of the dimension of the involved polynomial Krylov subspace.

The computational cost of the proposed algorithm is dominated by the construction of the Lanczos basis, and the compression steps do not require additional matrix-vector products involving $A$. Furthermore, theoretical results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves an approximation error comparable to that of the standard Lanczos algorithm, with an additional error term that can be bounded a priori using Zolotarev numbers. In practice, this additional error is negligible compared to the Lanczos error.

Numerical experiments show that the behavior of the proposed algorithm is comparable to that of the Lanczos algorithm without reorthogonalization, both in terms of matrix-vector products and quality of the approximated solution. Comparisons with existing low-memory variants of the Lanczos method demonstrate competitive performance in terms of accuracy, computational cost, and runtime.

Our method utilizes Hutchinson's stochastic trace estimator together with the Lanczos algorithm to approximate quadratic forms involving spectral projectors.\\
Instead of focusing on determining the gap between two particular consecutive eigenvalues of $A$, we aim to find all gaps that are wider than a specified threshold. By examining the problem from this perspective, and thoroughly analyzing both the Hutchinson and the Lanczos components of the algorithm, we obtain error bounds that allow us to determine the numbers of Hutchinson's sample vectors and Lanczos iterations needed to ensure the detection of all gaps above the target width with high probability.\\
We conclude that the most efficient strategy is to always use a single random sample vector for Hutchinson's estimator and concentrate all computational effort in the Lanczos algorithm. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of this approach.

Building on prior results~\cite{ahmad2025matrix}, we now investigate whether the assumption of invertibility of the GLT symbols almost everywhere is essential. Motivated by the fact that inversion is often required due to matrix non-commutativity, we explore the scenario where the symbols commute, aiming to relax the invertibility condition. Furthermore, we study the Karcher mean of more than two HPD GLT matrix-sequences, focusing on how an initial guess that itself belongs to the GLT algebra influences the convergence of the iterative computation. Numerical experiments support our theoretical claims and demonstrate improved convergence behavior under structured initialization.

Finally, we extend the theoretical results to the multilevel block case (for $r = 1$, $d \geq 1$), offering a a broader generalization and deeper numerical validation.

The rank-2 case is special in the sense that while the problem is NP-hard for general $r$ and somewhat trivial in the case of $r=1$, the complexity of rank-2 NMF is not known. Furthermore, NMF-2 is equivalent to rank-2 optimization with a non-negativity constraint, which is not true for larger $r$.
NMF-2 is commonly approached by solving for the components $A$ and $B$ separately in an alternating fashion (ANLS). This means solving several independent nonnegative least squares problems, which can be done exactly with relatively low computational cost in the rank-2 case. The ANLS method is not guaranteed to converge to the global minimum, and choosing a good starting point is crucial. Specifically, the ANLS method often seems to converge to a trivial solution with a column of zeros when the starting point is chosen carelessly. 
We suggest using a certain angular coordinate representation of the matrices $A$ and $B$ and then optimizing over these new sets of coordinates.
This approach has the benefit of introducing only a few zeros, which is a good property for a starting point for ANLS.
The tests we have implemented suggest that our method gives a better approximation than other existing methods such as SPA \cite{gillis2014hierarchical} while maintaining the same level of computational complexity.
Ideally the method could be generalized for $r > 2$, but it is still under consideration how this could be done.

Suppose that $n=k \ell$ points are classified into $k \geq 2$ communities with $\ell$ points in each community. These $n$ points are embedded independently and with uniform probability as points $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ of the $d$-dimensional flat unit torus $\mathbf{T^d}$. A random graph $G$ is generated so that the edge $\{i,j\}$ appears with probability $F_{in}(||X_i-X_j||)$ if $i$ and $j$ belong to the same community, and with probability $F_{out}(||X_i-X_j||)$  if $i$ and $j$ belong to different communities. Under some technical conditions about $F_{in}$ and $F_{out}$, we shall prove that asymptotically almost surely there is a set of $k-1$ eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix $A(G)$ whose eigenspaces allow us to correctly identify the members of each community. This strategy gives a spectral algorithm for community detection in random geometric graphs.

Classifying strongly reversible elements in a group is a problem of broad interest. It is known that an element of the general linear group over a field is strongly reversible if and only if it is similar to its inverse. However, this result does not hold for special linear groups over a field or a division ring.

Semimonotone matrices are noteworthy because of their appearance in studying the linear complementarity problem (LCP), which plays an significant role in areas of  bimatrix games, linear programming, quadratic programming etc.   A linear  map $\mathcal{L}:\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\to\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is said to be an {\it$X$-(linear) preserver} if it preserves certain property $X$, that is, if $X\subset\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, then $\mathcal{L}(X)\subseteq X$. In case, $\mathcal{L}(X)= X$, then $\mathcal{L}$ is known as an {\it onto/strong $X$-(linear) preserver}. In this paper, we study strong/onto linear preservers of semimonotone  and almost semimonotone (all proper principal submatrices are semimonotone) matrices. In particular, we prove that an onto $\mathbf{E}_0$-preserver can be written as direct sum of monomial and generalized monominal matrices. We further characterize all strong/onto $\mathbf{E}_0$-preservers in terms of transposition, permutation similarity and positive diagonal equivalence transformations. At last, we provide three types of onto linear preservers that preservers almost semimonotone matrices.

Every difference set gives rise to a symmetric balanced incomplete block design.

In 1933, R. Paley characterized when a set of squares forms a difference set. Later, S. Chowla extended this result to fourth powers. A difference set formed by $\ell$-th powers is called a power difference set. A natural question is whether all $\ell$-th power difference sets can be characterized. However, so far, researchers have only been able to construct such sets for $\ell = 2, 4, 8$ when $\ell \leq 24$, and it is conjectured that no other power difference sets exist.

Cyclotomic numbers captures the sizes of certain subsets intersections in a finite field. These numbers provide crucial information about the existence of a power difference set. The cyclotomic matrix is a matrix whose entries are cyclotomic numbers. By exploring properties of the cyclotomic matrix, we are able to conclude that if a power difference set exists, and if the size of elements outside the set is a square, then $\ell$ is congruent to $0$ or $2$ modulo $8$. This result holds for a power difference set that forms a finite projective plane. In contrast, our result allows for discussing an infinite number of $\ell$ values, extending the scope of previous finite cases. As far as we know, this may be the first application of cyclotomic matrices to power difference sets.

We propose a new method, based on the Schur form of a matrix pair and Riemannian optimization over the manifold $U(n) \times U(n)$, that is, the Cartesian product of the unitary group with itself. While the developed theory holds for any closed set $\Omega$, we focus on two cases that are the most common in applications: Hurwitz stability and Schur stability.

The coefficient matrix is assumed to be symmetric positive definite and spectrally equivalent to an average matrix for all parameters in a given set. We develop a Ritz method for rapidly approximating the eigenvalues on the spectral interval of interest $(0,\Lambda)$ for given parameter value. The Ritz subspace is the same for all parameters and it is designed based on the observation that any eigenvector can be split into two components. The first component belongs to a subspace spanned by some eigenvectors of the average matrix. The second component is defined by a correction operator that is a $d+1$ dimensional analytic function. We use this structure and build our Ritz subspace from eigenvectors of the average matrix and samples of the correction operator. The samples are evaluated at interpolation points related to a sparse polynomial interpolation method. We show that the resulting Ritz subspace can approximate eigenvectors of the original problem related to the spectral interval of interest with the same accuracy as the sparse polynomial interpolation approximates the correction operator. Bound for Ritz eigenvalue error follows from this and known results. Theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples. The advantage of our approach is that the analysis treats multiple eigenvalues and eigenvalue crossings that typically have posed technical challenges in similar works.

$R(s)$ is comprised by its invariant rational functions, both finite

studied in numerous references. However, $R(s)$ has other two fundamental
subspaces which, in contrast, have received much less attention
in the literature. They are its column and row spaces, which also have
their associated minimal indices. This work solves the problems of
finding necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of rational
matrices in two scenarios: (a) when the invariant rational functions and the minimal indices of the column and row spaces are prescribed,
and (b) when the complete eigenstructure together with the minimal
indices of the column and row spaces are prescribed. The particular,
but extremely important, cases of these problems for polynomial matrices
are solved first and are the main tool for solving the general
problems. The results in this work complete and extend non-trivially

for the existence of polynomial and rational matrices when only
the complete eigenstructure is prescribed.

This independence from the tree structure has been verified for many different variants of weighted bi-directed trees. In my talk (over an arbitrary commutative ring):
\begin{enumerate}
 \item I will present a general setting which strictly subsumes every known variant, and where we show that $\det(D_T)$ - as well as another graph invariant, the cofactor-sum - depends only on the edge-data, not the tree-structure.
 \item More generally - even in the original unweighted setting - we strengthen the state-of-the-art, by computing the minors of $D_T$ where one removes rows and columns indexed by equal-sized sets of pendant nodes. (In fact, we go beyond pendant nodes.)
 \item We explain why our result is the ``most general possible'', in that allowing greater freedom in the parameters leads to dependence on the tree-structure.
\end{enumerate}
We will discuss related results for arbitrary strongly connected graphs, including a third, novel invariant. If time permits, a formula for  $D_T^{-1}$ will be presented for trees $T$, whose special case answers an open problem of Bapat-Lal-Pati (Linear Alg. Appl. 2006), and which extends to our general setting a result of Graham-Lovasz (Advances in Math. 1978). (Joint with Apoorva Khare.)"

The error matrix function ${\rm erf}(A)$ and complimentary error matrix function ${\rm erfc}(A)$, which are introduced in \cite{Cortes}, are defined as 
$$
{\rm erf}(A) := \frac{2A}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{0}^{1} e^{-(Av)^{2}} dv \quad \mbox{and} \quad {\rm erfc}(A) := \frac{2A}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{1}^{\infty} e^{-(Av)^{2}} dv,
$$
respectively. 

One of the most important application of the complimentary error matrix function is the solution to systems of partial differential equation. 
Let $u_0, u(x,t) \in \mathbf{C}^n$. 
It is proven in \cite{Cortes} that the solution to semi-finite coupled diffusion problem 
\begin{eqnarray*}
u_{t} &=& A^2u_{xx}, \ x>0, \ t>0, \\
u(x,0) &=& 0, \ x>0, \quad 
u(0,t) = u_{0}, \ t>0, \quad 
u(x,t) \to 0, \ \textrm{as} \ x\rightarrow\infty, \ t > 0
\end{eqnarray*}
can be represented by using the complimentary error matrix function as follows:
$$
u(x,t) = {\rm erfc}\left(\frac{A^{-1}x}{2\sqrt{t}}\right)u_{0}, \quad x>0, \quad t>0. 
$$

Analogously to the scaler case, the functions ${\rm erf}(A)$ and ${\rm erfc}(A)$ satisfy the property ${\rm erf}(A) + {\rm erfc}(A) = I$, where $I$ is the $n \times n$ identity matrix. 
According to the Taylor expansion of $e^{-(Av)^{2}}$ where $v \in [0,1]$, and integrating term by term, we obtain 
$$
{\rm erf}(A) = \frac{2A}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^k A^{2k}}{k! (2k+1)}, 
$$
which is the Taylor expansion of ${\rm erf}(A)$ \cite{Cortes}. 
From this expansion and ${\rm erf}(A) + {\rm erfc}(A) = I$, we obtain 
$$
{\rm erfc}(A) = I - \frac{2A}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^k A^{2k}}{k! (2k+1)}. 
$$
In \cite{Cortes}, an upper bound on $\|{\rm erfc}(A)\|_2$ under the condition ${\rm Re}(\lambda) > |{\rm Im}(\lambda)|$, $\forall \lambda \in \sigma(A)$ has been derived as a corollary of the fact that ${\rm erfc}(A)$ is well-defined. 

The purpose of this talk is to present the following norm bounds: 
\begin{itemize}
\item a new upper bound on $\|{\rm erfc}(A)\|_2$ under a condition which is different from ${\rm Re}(\lambda) > |{\rm Im}(\lambda)|$, $\forall \lambda \in \sigma(A)$, 
\item upper bounds on $\|{\rm erf}(A) - {\rm erf}(B)\|_2$ and $\|{\rm erfc}(A) - {\rm erfc}(B)\|_2$, where $B \in \mathbf{C}^{n \times n}$, under an assumption, and 
\item upper bounds on 
$$
\left\|{\rm erf}(A) - \frac{2A}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sum_{k=0}^{m}\frac{(-1)^k A^{2k}}{k! (2k+1)}\right\|_2 \ \mbox{and} \ 
\left\|{\rm erfc}(A) - \left(I - \frac{2A}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sum_{k=0}^{m}\frac{(-1)^kA^{2k}}{k!(2k+1)}\right)\right\|_2,
$$ 
where $m$ is a nonnegative integer, under an assumption. 
\end{itemize}
We report results of numerical experiments in order to observe how much larger the presented bounds are compared to the corresponding norms.

Hence it is a Trade-off Principle. It seems to violet our cognition about ill/well-conditioned problems. In this talk we like to extend this principle, i.e. there is no case where the error and the condition number are both small, from interpolation matrices to arbitrary linear systems. The underlying theory behind the conflict between accuracy and stability flips our misconceptions about condition numbers and provides us with a brand-new interpretation of it.

\begin{equation*}
{\mathcal{P}}_{n}=\{p \in {{\mathbb{R}}}[x]: p(A)\geq 0 \mbox{ for all~}  A \geq 0, A \in {\mathbb{R}}^{n,n}\}.
\end{equation*}
${\mathcal{P}}_{n}$ was defined by Loewy and London, motivated by the Nonnegative Inverse Eigenvalue Problem (NIEP), but is of independent interest. Clearly, ${\mathcal{P}}_{n}$ is a closed, convex cone.

\medskip
Given any polynomial $p$, we identify $p$ with its sequence of coefficients. In order to consider only finite dimensional vector spaces, we restrict the degree of the polynomials. Given a positive integer $m$, define

\begin{equation*}
{\mathcal{P}}_{n,m}=\{p \in {\mathcal{P}}_{n} : degree(p) \leq m \}.
\end{equation*}
Then, ${\mathcal{P}}_{n,m}$ can be thought as a cone in ${\mathbb{R}}^{m+1}$.

\medskip
It is clear that any polynomial with nonnegative coefficients is in ${\mathcal{P}}_{n}$. Therefore, the number, relative size and distribution of the negative coefficients of polynomials in ${\mathcal{P}}_{n}$ are of significant interest. Clark and Paparella showed that if $p \in {\mathcal{P}}_{n}$, then its first and last $n$ coefficients must be nonnegative. Hence, ${\mathcal{P}}_{n,m}$ is a simplicial cone, for any $0 < m <2n$.

\medskip
Let $m \geq 2n$. Then, ${\mathcal{P}}_{n,m}$ contains polynomials with negative coefficients. For example, there exists $a > 0$ such that $1+x+x^{2}+\cdots+x^{n-1}-ax^{n}+x^{n+1}+\cdots+x^{2n} \in {\mathcal{P}}_{n,2n}$ (the question of the optimal $a$ is of interest).
It follows that the structure of ${\mathcal{P}}_{n,m}$ is nontrivial. We consider its face structure, and in particular the one dimensional faces, that is, the extreme rays. Using some information on the possible coefficients of polynomials in  ${\mathcal{P}}_{n,m}$, we show that  ${\mathcal{P}}_{n,m}$ is not polyhedral, that is, contains infinitely many extreme rays. Additional preliminary results on the faces are obtained."

Roughly speaking, two objects are said to be {\em complementary} if being certain about one of them necessarily forbids useful knowledge about the other. Two quantum measurements that do not commute form an example of complementary measurements, and this phenomenon can also be defined for ensembles of states. Although a key quantum feature, it is unclear whether complementarity can be understood more operationally, as a necessary resource in some quantum information task. Here we show this is the case, and relates to a novel task which we term {\em $\eta$-unambiguous exclusion}. As well as giving complementarity a clear operational definition, this also uncovers the foundational underpinning of unambiguous exclusion tasks for the first time. \\\\

type of nonlinear matrix-valued equation and an essential component
of many applications, including controller design, model order reduction and
game theory.
While there have been many developments in recent years regarding new solution
methods of CAREs in the setting of large-scale sparse coefficient matrices,
these methods are typically based on semi-definite low-rank factorizations of
their solutions and consider the classical CARE formulation
\begin{equation*}
  A^{\mathsf{T}} X E + E^{\mathsf{T}} X A + C^{\mathsf{T}} Q C -
    E^{\mathsf{T}} X B R B^{\mathsf{T}} X E = 0,

where $Q$ and $R$ can be symmetric positive definite,  negative definite,
or even indefinite.
The solutions and intermediate approximations to such general equations often
do not follow the classical semi-definite structure.
Therefore, we are utilizing low-rank symmetric indefinite $LDL^{\mathsf{T}}$
factorizations of the CARE solution in our algorithms, which enable efficient
computations; see, for example,~\cite{Werner_SaaW24}.

While extensive research has been conducted on the Greatest Common Divisors (GCDs) of scalar polynomials, the study of GCRDs in polynomial matrices remains relatively limited. It is important to develop fast and reliable ways to compute both exact and approximate GCRD, especially when dealing with approximate cases where the data is corrupted by noise.\\
We address the problem of computing both exact and approximate GCRDs for a given set of univariate polynomial matrices $B_1(s), \dots, B_t(s)$. We establish a key theoretical result—proving that the rank deficiency of a particular generalized Sylvester matrix associated with $P(s)$, where $P(s)$ is obtained by stacking $B_1(s), \dots, B_t(s)$ one below the other, corresponds to the degree of the determinant of their GCRD. This equivalence enables us to develop efficient algorithms for computing an exact GCRD using \textit{Effectively Eliminating QR} (EEQR) decomposition and $SVD$ of that particular generalized Sylvester matrix. $SVD$ can handle noise-corrupted data, making it particularly effective for computing an approximate GCRD. This approach leverages the numerical rank of that particular generalized Sylvester matrix to estimate the degree of an approximate GCRD. Both algorithms are simple to develop, easy to understand, and convenient to implement, ensuring scalability.\\
We validate our results through various numerical examples, demonstrating their effectiveness. These findings have significant implications for applications requiring polynomial matrix factorizations and simplifications in the presence of noise and uncertainty."

Completion problems of matrices frequently arise in applications, for instance in structural changes of the dynamics of a system or in pole placement problems in control  theory. They also appear in solutions of perturbation problems. 
This work is devoted to the row completion problem for polynomial and rational matrices. 
We characterize the existence of a polynomial matrix when its complete structural data  (the invariant factors, the invariants orders at infinity, and the column and row minimal indices) and some of its rows are prescribed, allowing the completed matrix to increase the degree.
The same problem is solved for rational matrices.
We have also  solved the corresponding problem of partial prescription of the complete structural data covering  all of the possibilities. We will show here some cases.
Obviously, the results obtained hold for the corresponding column  completion problems.

In this talk I will share a universal approach to vertex set parameter reconfiguration developed with Leslie Hogben and Bryan Curtis that is applied to zero forcing variants as well as other common graph parameters. Zero forcing was developed in this community to be an upper bound to the nullity of any real symmetric matrix with off-diagonal zero pattern determined by the adjacency matrix of a given graph. Understanding zero forcing sets has applications to understanding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices. 
Reconfiguration is also a description of how Leslie Hogben has helped to change our community for the better, one step at a time by facilitating community and research opportunity to graduate students, new researchers and faculty at undergraduate institutions. I will share my perspective on her reconfiguration efforts.

It is safe to say, the Leslie has personally opened the door to the IEP-G and Zero forcing to more people than anyone else (and it is not even close).  Her devotion to this topic and her steadfast support and encouragement to engage with so many researchers is astonishing…I hope to highlight several instances of Leslie's leadership and guidance that has shaped the direction of both the IEP-G and topics related to Zero forcing. When you look at the past 25 years her stamp is nearly everywhere on the IEP-G and Zero forcing. Personally, she was instrumental in supporting my research and I am truly blessed to have published 15 papers with my friend Dr. Leslie Hogben!"

Zero forcing is a propagation process on a network whereby some nodes are initially blue with all others white. Blue vertices can ``force'' a white neighbor to become blue if all other  neighbors are blue. The goal is to find the minimum number of initially blue vertices to eventually force all vertices blue after exhaustively applying the forcing rule above.
Leaky forcing is a fault-tolerant variation of zero forcing where certain vertices (not necessarily initially blue) cannot force. The goal in this context is to find the minimum number of initially blue vertices needed that can eventually force all vertices to be blue, {\it regardless} of which small number of vertices can't force.

This work extends results from zero forcing in terms of leaky forcing. New results regarding leaky forcing presented here include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete determination of all leaky forcing numbers for all unicyclic graphs.
\item Robust upper bounds for generalized Petersen graphs.
\item Bounds for the effect of both edge removal and vertex removal.
\item A complete characterization for which connected graphs have the maximum possible $1$-leaky forcing number (i.e., when $Z_{(1)}(G) = |V(G)|-1$).
\end{itemize}

In the setting of a semi-FTvN system (in particular, in an FTvN system), we show that strong commutativity implies commutativity and observe that in the special case of Euclidean Jordan algebra, commutativity and strong commutativity concepts reduce, respectively, to those of operator and strong operator commutativity. We demonstrate that every complete hyperbolic polynomial induces a semi-FTvN system. By way of an application, we describe several commutation principles.

The recurrence coefficients of this relation can be stored in a Hessenberg pencil. Two important numerical methods are those based on Krylov subspace methods and those based on restoring matrix structures. The methods are based on the connection between Sobolev orthonormal rational functions and the orthonormal bases for rational Krylov subspaces generated by a Jordan-like matrix."

","Multiple orthogonal polynomials (MOPs) arise in various applications, including approximation theory, random matrix theory, and numerical integration. To define MOPs, one needs orthogonality conditions with respect to multiple measures. In this talk, we restrict our attention to the case of two measures. These MOPs satisfy recurrence relations, and we focus specifically on the stepline recurrence relation.
We derive an inverse eigenvalue problem: given some initial spectral data, retrieve the recurrence matrix associated with the stepline recurrence relation. Several techniques for solving this inverse problem are proposed, and numerical illustrations are provided to demonstrate their correctness.

The algorithm that we propose combines the Lanczos method for $f(A) b$ with a basis compression procedure involving rational Krylov subspaces, which is employed whenever the basis grows beyond a certain size in order to reduce memory usage. 
This method has essentially the same convergence behaviour as Lanczos, with the addition of an error term that depends on rational approximation of the function $f$ and is typically negligible. 
The cost of the basis compression procedure is also negligible with respect to the cost of the Lanczos algorithm. In particular, the rational Krylov subspaces used for the compression of the Lanczos basis are built using small projected matrices, so their construction is cheap and does not require the expensive solution of linear systems with the matrix $A$. 
Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits competitive performance when compared against other low-memory methods for $f(A) b$.
