For example,
\begin{align*}
&\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,p}(A,B):=(\alpha A^p+(1-\alpha)B^p)^{1/p},
\ \text{the quasi-weighted arithmetic mean}, \\
&G_{\alpha,p}(A,B):=(A^p\#_\alpha B^p)^{1/p},
\ \text{the quasi-weighted geometric mean}, \\
&R_{\alpha,p}(A,B):=\bigl(B^{{\frac{1-\alpha}{2}}p}A^{\alpha p}B^{{\frac{1-\alpha}{2}}p}\bigr)^{1/p},
\ \text{the R\'enyi mean}, \\
&LE_\alpha(A,B):=\exp(\alpha\log A+(1-\alpha)\log B),
\ \text{the weighted Log-Euclidean mean},
\end{align*}
where $\alpha\in(0,1)$ (or all $\alpha>0$) is the weight parameter and $p>0$ is the parameter of the quasi extension.
For the quasi versions of these weighted matrix means we consider inequalities in different types of orders such as the Loewner order $\le$, the chaotic $\le_{\mathrm{ch}}$ (i.e., $\log X\le \log Y$), the near order $\le_{\mathrm{ne}}$ (i.e., $X\#Y^{-1}\le I$), the entrywise eigenvalue order $\le_\lambda$, the log-majorization $\prec_{\log}$, the weak majorization $\prec_w$, and the order under trace (i.e., $\mathrm{Tr}\,X\le\mathrm{Tr}\,Y$), whose order relations weaken in this writing order.
Our objective is to pursue under which condition of the parameters $\alpha,p,q$ the inequality $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)\triangleleft\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ holds for all positive (semi)definite matrices $A,B$, for any pair $(\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p},\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q})$ from the above quasi-weighted means and for any order $\triangleleft$ mentioned above.
For instance, it is shown that $\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)\le\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ holds for all $A,B\ge0$ if and only if $p=q$ or $1\le p<q$ or $1/2\le p<1\le q$, whereas, for any other weaker order $\triangleleft$, $\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)\triangleleft\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ holds for all $A,B\ge0$ if and only if $p\le q$. When $(\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p},\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q})$ is a pair from the quasi-weighted geometric type means, we are mostly interested in the condition of $\alpha,p,q$ under which the log-majorization $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)\prec_{\log}\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ holds and whether $AB=BA$ follows from the equality case $\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)=\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ in this situation."

","We explore the family ${\mathcal S}(G)$ of real symmetric matrices whose off-diagonal zero-nonzero pattern matches the one of the adjacency matrix of a given simple graph $G$. Our focus is on the eigenvalue multiplicities that such matrices can attain, which is a subproblem of the well-studied Inverse Eigenvalue Problem for a Graph (IEP-$G$).



While every ${\mathcal S}(G)$ contains a matrix with all eigenvalues simple, understanding constraints on high multiplicities remains a significant challenge. 
Interpreting multiplicity lists as partitions, we will examine the following key parameters: the maximum achievable multiplicity of any eigenvalue, the largest possible minimal multiplicity, and the minimal number of distinct eigenvalues attainable by matrices in ${\mathcal S}(G)$.
We will also discuss constraints on matrices that realise the extreme values of the relevant parameter.

When considered as a linear map, it is natural to introduce the relation of ``similarity'', $P^{-1}AP$ (with $P$ invertible), which is a change of basis that allows us to represent the linear map in a simpler form, in particular in the well-known ``Jordan canonical form''. When considering the matrix $A$ as a bilinear form, the natural relation instead is the one of ``congruence'', $P^\top AP$ (with $P$ invertible), which is the suitable change of basis for bilinear forms. Is there a canonical form for such a relation? The answer is yes, and actually some different canonical forms for congruence have been introduced over the years since the 1930's. In this talk I will introduce the most recent one (by Horn and Sergeichuk, 2006), review the history of this and the other canonical forms, and show some applications in the context of my past and current research, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The solution of the equation $AX+X^\top A=0$ and its connection to $\top$-palindromic pencils.
    \item The consistency of the equation $X^\top AX=B$ when $B$ is either symmetric or skew-symmetric.

One of its most famous appearances is arguably in Gaussian elimination for solving linear systems, where a good choice of pivots is crucial for numerical stability. This talk will focus on pivoting in the context of low-dimensional approximation, including column subset selection, discrete empirical interpolation, and various interpolative decompositions, such as the CUR and Cholesky/Nystrom approximations. In all of these cases, a greedy choice of pivots usually works well but there are well-known counterexamples where such a choice leads to poor results. We present a new randomized pivot selection strategy that avoids such unfavorable worst-case performance by using adaptivity in two senses: It adapts to information on the range / co-range of a matrix, and the sampling distribution is updated after each pivot selection. Adaptive randomized pivoting enjoys error guarantees that match, in expectation, the best known existence results. At the same time, it is   simpler and usually cheaper than volume-based techniques, which achieve similar guarantees through volume sampling or iterative local volume maximization. We will illustrate several applications of adaptive randomized pivoting and discuss derandomized variants. This talk is based on joint work with Alice Cortinovis, University of Pisa."

We show specific examples where the analysis of matrix structures, besides providing a better understanding of the original problem, is a fundamental step in designing effective ad hoc solution algorithms.

Two specific issues are considered:  the analysis of random walks on a regular grid in the quarter plane, and the assessment of the centrality of the edges in a graph. Both issues derive from the analysis of relevant real-world problems and are modeled by Markov chains describing random walks on a graph. 

In the first topic, the graph is a regular grid, and the specific features of the problem lead to semi-infinite transition probability matrices with a two-level tridiagonal and almost Toeplitz structure. We show that these matrices live in a suitable infinite-dimensional structured matrix algebra which is also a Banach space with respect to the infinity norm. This fact will be crucial to designing effective fast algorithms for computing the steady-state vector of the associated Markov chain.

In the second topic, the graph is typically a road map of a city or region. Thus, the Toeplitz structure of the associated transition probability matrix is lost. However, the sparsity and band structure of this matrix will allow us to easily compute a centrality measure of the edges defined in terms of Kemeny's constant of the associated Markov chain. The effectiveness of the model and the solution algorithms is tested on the road maps of Pisa and Tuscany.

The task of learning an adequate similarity measure on various feature spaces often involves  graphs with high clustering coefficients.
We investigate the clustering effect in sparse  clustering graphs by examining the structural and spectral  properties as well as the enumeration  of patterns. In addition, we consider random graph models for clustering graphs that can be use to analyze the behavior of complex networks."

","My research focuses on variations of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado (EKR) theorem. The question was to determine the largest set of subsets of size $k$ from $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, with the property that any two of the $k$-subsets have non-empty intersection. The Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado (EKR) theorem states that a largest such set can only be formed by taking all $k$-subsets that contain a common fixed point.

More generally, for any object for which ``intersection'' can be defined, we can ask the same question: what is the largest set of objects with the property that any two objects in the set have non-empty intersection? For many objects the answer to this question is a result analogous to EKR theorem for $k$-subsets. When this holds, it can be considered to be an \textbf{EKR-type theorem}.

Typically, these questions are considered to be problems from design theory and there are many different proof approaches that can applied. In my work (and in my opinion) the best results come from using tools from linear algebra. 

In this talk, I will give an overview of how to use linear algebra to prove EKR-type theorems. My focus will be on results for intersecting sets of permutations from transitive groups. For these objects (the permutations) we define a graph, called \textbf{the derangement graph}. The eigenvalues of the this graph can be determined from the group, and the using the \textbf{ratio bound} the eigenvalues give a bound on the size of the largest intersecting set of permutations. This graph has lovely algebraic properties, in particular it is a graph in an association scheme, which means that strong tools from linear algebra are available.

independent component analysis, blind source separation, and common principal component analysis (CPCA),
among others. CPCA, a special case, is about joint diagonalization, i.e.,
each blocksize being 1-by-1. In the last fifteen years or so, CPCA has attracted a great deal of attention because
of its applications to, e.g., multivariate data analysis and multiview  clustering.
Generically three or more matrices cannot be jointly block-diagonalized, but practically,
a reasonably good approximate joint block-diagonalization suffices  for
real-world applications. This talk is concerned with fast  {\em Principal Joint Block Diagonalization\/}, in which
our focus is on dominant and partial common block-diagonal structure among the 
matrices of interest, in contrast to most existing methods, such as the popular ones based on Givens' rotation,
which by nature have to go for full joint diagonalization and can be too time-consuming to be practical for a group of modest sized matrices
that are not sufficiently close to being jointly diagonalizable.
An NPDo approach is proposed for maximizing the common dominant block-diagonal parts.
It is shown the NPDo approach is globally convergent to a stationary point
while the objective function increases monotonically. Along similar lines,
joint principal SVD-type block-diagonalization is also investigated.
Numerical experiments will be presented to illustrate the use of the NPDo approach and demonstrate its superiority
to existing methods for matrices of dimension 200 or larger.

","Developed in a series of seminal papers in the early 2010s, the tubal tensor framework provides a clean and effective algebraic setting for tensor computations, supporting matrix-mimetic features such as a tensor Singular Value Decomposition and Eckart–Young-like optimality results. It has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing inherently multilinear data arising in hyperspectral imaging, medical imaging, neural dynamics, scientific simulations, and more.

At the heart of tubal tensor algebra lies a special tensor-tensor product: originally the t-product, later generalized into a full family of products via the *M-product. Though initially defined through the multiplication of a block-circulant unfolding of one tensor by a matricization of another, it was soon observed that the t-product can be interpreted as standard matrix multiplication where the scalars are tubes—i.e., real vectors twisted ``inward.'' Yet, a fundamental question remains: Why is this the ``right'' way to define a tensor-tensor product in the tubal setting?

In the talk, I will discuss the mathematical foundations of the tubal tensor framework, and discuss applications and extensions. In particular, I will show that the t-product and its *M generalization arises naturally when viewing third-order tensors as matrices of tubes, together with a small set of desired natural algebraic properties. Furthermore,*M-product is, in fact, the unique way to define a tubal product satisfying these properties, and these desired properties are required for the tubal SVD and Eckart–Young-like optimality results.

Completion is more important for tensors than for matrices for several reasons. Higher-order datasets are larger, increasing the likelihood of missing or unreliable entries. Large-scale data often exhibits low-rank properties (intuitively, not every entry is ``equally important,'' unlike in smaller matrices). Many interesting problems can be framed as instances of low-rank tensor completion, including image and video recovery, collaborative filtering, and quantum state tomography \cite{liu2013tc, gross2010quantum}. Low-rank tensor completion is generally solved via convex optimization techniques. Current theories concerning these methods often study probabilistic recovery guarantees under conditions such as random uniform observations and incoherence requirements \cite{candes2009exact, liu2013tc}. However, if an observation pattern has some structure, more efficient algorithms can be developed by leveraging the structure.\par

Algebraic methods exploit the low-rank structure to design algorithms that rely solely on standard numerical linear algebra (NLA) operations. They are fast and are guaranteed to work under reasonable deterministic conditions on the observation pattern. In this line, a specific type of ``fiber-wise'' observation pattern has been discussed, where some of the fibers of a tensor (along a specific mode) are either fully observed or entirely missing, unlike the usual entry-wise observations. This observation is interesting because it appears in many real-life applications and highlights a key difference between matrices and tensors. While missing fibers (rows or columns) in a matrix make completion underdetermined, higher-order tensors can still be completed even if some fibers are entirely missing along one mode. It has been shown that under reasonable conditions, canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) and multilinear singular value decomposition (MLSVD) of such an incomplete tensor can still be obtained using only standard NLA \cite{mikael2019fibersamp, stijn2023mlsvdfsj}. Note that there is an important difference with the technique of cross or skeleton approximation in the sense that we assume the availability of fibers in one mode only. \par

With the increasing prevalence of big data, the demand for reliable and scalable algorithms has become more pressing. The tensor train (TT) decomposition is stable and can break the curse of dimensionality \cite{oseledets2010tensortrain}. This talk shows how to extend the fiber-wise completion to the TT format. We discuss the deterministic conditions under which the uniqueness of the solution is guaranteed \cite{stijn2023mlsvdfsj, shakir2024ttfw}. Furthermore, we discuss a few interesting applications and briefly highlight the possibility of utilizing this tensor completion framework as a fundamental experimental primitive for efficient quantum state tomography with fewer measurements.

Let $\mathcal{B}(H)$ be the set of all bounded linear operators on a complex Hilbert space. An operator $T\in \mathcal{B}(H)$ satisfies $\mathcal{AN}$-property if and only if for any closed subspace $K$ of $H$, there exists a unit vector $x\in K$ such that $\|T|_{K}\|=\|T|_{K}x\|$. The set of operators satisfying $\mathcal{AN}$-property is not closed. 
Moreover $\mathcal{AN}$-property is not stable under some operations.
In this talk, we shall introduce stability of $\mathcal{AN}$-property under functional calculus on positive definite operators.

In other words, there exist constants $K>0$ and $0<\xi<1$, independent of matrix size, such that 
$$
[A^{-1}]_{ij}\leq K \xi^{|i-j|}.
$$
Several versions of such bounds are available in the literature. Most of them rely on polynomial approximation of the function $x\rightarrow 1/x$ on a convex subset of $\mathbb{C}$ containing the spectrum of $A$; see for instance the seminal work by Demko, Moss and Smith \cite{DMS84}.

Here we take a different approach, which exploits the quasiseparable structure of $A$ and $A^{-1}$. Based on recently proposed inversion algorithms for banded matrices \cite{BE23}, we develop new decay bounds for inverses of one-sided and two-sided banded matrices, under a hypothesis of strong diagonal dominance. Our bounds are easily computable, do not require spectral information on $A$ and can be advantageous for symmetric indefinite or nonsymmetric matrices.

","Perfect codes have been key subject of study since the emergence of coding theory in the late 1940s, and they continue to garner considerable interest even after more than sixty years. Hamming and Golay codes are well-known perfect codes, and their significance to information theory is widely recognized. A \textit{code} in a graph $X=(V,E)$ is a non-empty subset of $V$. Given an integer $t\geq 1$, the ball with radius $t$ and centre $u \in V$ is defined as $B_t(u, X) := \{v \in V: d(u, v) \leq t\}$, where $d(u,v)$ is the distance in $X$ between $u$ and $v$. A code $C\subseteq V$ is called a \textit{perfect t-error-correcting code} or a \textit{perfect t-code} in $X$ if the balls $B_t(u, X)$ with radius $t$ and centres $u\in C$ form a partition of $V$. In graph theory, $B_t(u, X)$ is called the $t$-neighbourhood of $u$ in $X$, each vertex in $B_t(u, X)$ is said to be \textit{$t$-dominated} by$u$, a perfect $t$-code in $X$ is called a \textit{perfect t-dominating set} of $X$, and a perfect 1-code in $X$ is called an \textit{efficient dominating set} or \textit{independent perfect dominating set}. In this talk, our goal is to highlight the interplay between the perfect 1-codes and the eigenvalues of graphs. In particular, we focus on the spectrum of special classes of graphs such as Cayley graphs and circulant graphs, and characterize a perfect-1-code in such graphs.  
%Note that this vector has $n/2r$ entries $-(2r-1)$ as we need $(2r) |C| = n$ for $C$ being a perfect code. All other entries of this eigenvector are $1$, so the entry-sum is $0$.

In this presentation, we discuss the advantages and role of randomization in iterative methods for approximating the solution to large-scale linear systems. Time permitting, we will also discuss our recent work on applications to solving systems involving higher-dimensional arrays, or tensors.

Recent advances in matrix-mimetic tensor algebra in have made it possible to preserve linear algebraic properties and, as a result, to obtain optimal representations of multiway data. Matrix-mimeticity arises from interpreting tensors as t-linear operators, which in turn are parameterized by invertible linear transformations. The choice of transformation is critical to representation quality, and thus far, has been made heuristically. In this talk, we will learn data-dependent, orthogonal transformations by leveraging the optimality of matrix-mimetic representations. In particular, we will exploit the coupling between transformations and optimal tensor representations using variable projection.

While SDR methods have been extensively studied, coordinate testing, which assesses the contribution of a set of linear combinations of covariates, has been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we propose a novel method that transforms the coordinate testing problem into a dimension testing problem by applying appropriate residualization. Since dimension tests are well-established, this method allows practitioners to leverage existing inference tools within the SDR framework.

Recent advances in reconstruction models have enabled the characterization of structural heterogeneity from cryo-EM images through high-dimensional latent spaces. However, constructing conformational landscapes in these spaces and identifying preferred transition pathways remain major challenges. 

In this study, we propose a novel framework for identifying preferred trajectories within high-dimensional conformational landscapes. Our method formulates the problem as a graph-based search for minimum energy paths, where edge weights are computed from local energy estimates derived from density in high-dimensional space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by accurately identifying transition states in both synthetic and experimental datasets exhibiting continuous conformational changes.

\[
D_f(P,Q) = \max_i \big( f(q_i) - f(p_i) \big),

Under mild regularity assumptions on \(f\), the quasimetric space $(\Delta_N,D_f)$ has a Finslerian structure and admits geodesics (both forward and backward) between any two points. Moreover, the function \(D_f\) is monotone under bistochastic maps.

In this talk, I present two results that reformulate key protocols using tools from matrix analysis: an equality-based version of the convex split lemma, relying on collision mutual information derived from the sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy of order $2$, and the induced divergence, a new family of smoothed quantum divergences. These developments yield sharper achievability bounds for state merging, splitting, and communication over quantum channels, while highlighting the central role of the collision relative entropy in quantum information."

","We study some basic theoretical and implementation issues
of quantum state tomography problems.
Under the assumption that one can do 
measurements of many identical copies of a quantum state
$\rho$ represented as an $N\times N$ density matrix,
we show that one can determine (estimate) $\rho$ using the 
measurements with respect to $N+1$ different bases, 
i.e,,  the quantum state can be determined diagonal entries of 
$U_j\rho U_j^\dag$, where $U_j$ is a unitary matrix  for $j = 0, \dots, N$.
When $N = 2^n$, one may choose unitary $U_0, \dots, U_N$ corresponding
to a collection of mutually unbiased bases. We show that the recovery of the
quantum state using such measurements will involve the solving an 
ill-conditioned linear system. For a more stable scheme in terms of
measurements and determination of the quantum state from the measurement values,
we show that one may also use the measurements of 
$V_j \rho V_j^\dag$ to determine the quantum state for $j = 1, \dots, 3^n$,
where each $V_j$ corresponds to a local measurement operator,
i.e., $V_j$ is a tensor product of $2\times 2$ unitary matrices.
It is proved that $3^n$ is the minimum number of local measurement bases
one can use to determine an $n$-qubit state.
Moreover, we show that one may determine $\rho$ by a single measurement
basis using an ancilla $\rho$ of the same dimension as $\rho$.
In other words, we can determine $\rho$ using
the diagonal entries of $U(\sigma \otimes \rho)U^\dag$, where
$\sigma$ is an $n$-qubit pure state.
All the above schemes are demonstrated using the IBM online computers.

To keep the scope manageable, we focus on the standard sphere \(S^2\) in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) with three points, introducing new ideas beyond minimizing squared geodesic distances.

With the recent developments in quantum information theory,  Williamson's normal form has opened up an active research area that may be dubbed as ``finite dimensional symplectic spectral theory'', analogous to the usual spectral theory and matrix analysis. An infinite dimensional analogue of the Williamson's Normal form has appeared recently and has already become a corner stone for the theory of infinite mode quantum Gaussian states. However, most existing results pertain to finite-dimensional operators, leaving a dearth of literature in the infinite-dimensional context. The aim of this talk is to discuss some recent results in this direction. Specifically, we discuss the recently proved inequality between the eigenvalues and symplectic eigenvalues for positive invertible operators $T$ on $\mathcal{H} \oplus \mathcal{H}$ (where $\mathcal{H}$ is a real separable Hilbert space) such that $T- \alpha I$ is compact for some $\alpha > 0$ and see its applications on the Gaussian covariance operators and positive Absolutely Norm attaining operators ($(\mathcal{AN})_+$ operators). We also show that the symplectic spectrum lies within the bounds of the spectrum for operators on specific classes. Additionally, we provide a method to recover the symplectic spectrum of Gaussian covariance operators through truncation."

","Even large amounts of data can be efficiently realized by imposing structures into neural networks through structured weight matrices. These structured weight matrices could be trained to realize phase shifts for specific beams in multi-beam beamforming, along with input and output vectors made up of time-domain signals. In our previous research, we showed that wideband multi-beam beamformers using true-time-delays (TTDs) can be represented by delay Vandermonde matrices (DVM). We use a frequency-domain transformation to explicitly express the TTD-based time delay data in terms of the elements of the DVM-structured weight matrices. Building upon these weight matrices, we introduce a novel low-complexity neural network LSTM architecture for realizing wideband multi-beam beamformers. The proposed structured LSTM network reduces the computational complexity for realizing wideband multi-beam beamformers from $\mathcal{O}(N^2L)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N^sL)$, where $1 < s < 2$ and $L$ is the number of layers.

These accelerators deliver extraordinary throughput by trading off some degree of accuracy, and, to fully utilise their potential, we must rely on low-precision floating-point formats such as binary16, bfloat16, or binary8.
These reduced-precision formats can have a throughput up to two orders of magnitude higher than binary64, but they lack the precision needed for traditional scientific simulations, which require higher accuracy to yield meaningful results.
To integrate GPUs effectively into scientific computing, we must reimagine high-precision computations by strategically applying lower precision whenever feasible.

We consider techniques to solve the general Sylvester equation $AX + XB = C$ in mixed precision.
By revisiting a stationary iteration for linear systems, we derive a new iterative refinement scheme for the quasi-triangular Sylvester equation.
We then leverage this iterative scheme to solve the general Sylvester equation in mixed precision.
The new algorithms compute the Schur decomposition of the matrix coefficients in low precision, use the low-precision Schur factors to obtain an approximate solution to the quasi-triangular equation, and iteratively refine it to obtain a working-precision solution to the quasi-triangular equation.
However, being only orthonormal to low precision, the unitary Schur factors of A and B cannot be used to recover the solution to the original equation.
We propose two effective approaches to address this issue: one is based on re-orthonormalization in the working precision, and the other on explicit inversion of the almost-unitary factors.

In the matrix groups one of the most famous one is being an involution. The famous theorem states that every square matrix with determinant $\pm 1$ defined over a field is a product of at most four involutions. Simply by their definition, the involutions satisfy equation $x^2-1=0$, i.e. a quadratic equation. Hence, it is natural to raise a question does a similar result hold for matrices that satisfy some other fixed quadratic equation.
\par
Consider a field $F$ and an algebra $\mathcal{A}$ defined over $F$. Define polynomial $q$ by the formula $q(x)=a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$, where $a_2 \neq 0$. If element $a \in \mathcal{A}$ satisfies $q(a)=0$, then we say that $a$ is quadratic with respect to $q(x)$, or shortly that $a$ is $q(x)$-quadratic.
Recently, Bien et al. \cite{bi_ta_tr_tr} proved that every $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ upper triangular matrix whose diagonal entries are of the form $\lambda_1^{s_i}\lambda_2^{t_i}$, where $s_i+t_i=k$ for every $i \in \mathbb{N}$, $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2 \neq 0$, can be expressed as a product of at most $k$ quadratic matrices with respect to $q_{\lambda_1,\lambda_2}(x)=(x-\lambda_1)(x-\lambda_2)$.
This result brings up further questions. Does the same claim holds when $\lambda_1\lambda_2=0$? Does it also hold when we replace the quadratic polynomial by a polynomial of degree $n$ ($\ngeqslant 3$)? During this talk we are going to discuss these issues.

 We work on  unitary $(t-1)$-matching $t$-Cayley graph of ${\mathcal{R}}$ and its complement graph. We show that the graphs are hyperenergetic and obtain a criterion on $t$ and the rings ${\mathcal{R}}$ for each graph being a Ramanujan graph.

There are two types of quantum walk: continuous-time quantum walk and discrete-time quantum walk. We focus on the Grover walk, a type of discrete-time quantum walk. The unitary Cayley graph  has vertex set $\{0,1, \hdots ,n-1\}$, where two vertices  $u$ and $v$ are adjacent if $\gcd(u - v, n) = 1$. We study periodicity and perfect state transfer of Grover walks on the unitary Cayley graphs. We characterize all periodic unitary Cayley graphs. We prove that periodicity is a necessary condition for the occurrence of perfect state transfer on a vertex-transitive graph. Also, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of perfect state transfer on circulant graphs. Using these, we prove that only four graphs in the class of unitary Cayley graphs exhibit perfect state transfer. Also, we provide a spectral characterization of the periodicity of Grover walks on integral regular graphs.

Moore-Penrose inverse of a circum-Euclidean distance matrix (CEDM), in this 
talk, we study a general real square matrix $M$  whose Moore-Penrose inverse 
can be expressed as the sum of a Laplacian-like matrix $L$  and a rank one 
matrix. In particular, for a symmetric hollow matrix $M$, under an assumption, 
we show that $M$ is a Euclidean distance matrix if and only if $L$ is positive

involving their Moore-Penrose inverses. As an application, we show that the 
distance matrices of block graphs and odd-cycle-clique graphs are CEDMs. 
Finally, we establish an interlacing property between the eigenvalues of  a
Euclidean distance matrix $M$ (including the singular case) and its associated 
Laplacian-like matrix $L$, which generalizes the interlacing property proved 
for the distance matrices of trees.

This result has an implicit importance due to the fact that nonsingular tridiagonal matrices arise in a variety of problems in pure and applied mathematics and for this reason they have been extensively studied in the literature. However, the singular case has received comparatively much lesser attention. In particular, there has been little focus on the generalized inverses of such matrices.  In this paper, we provide a complete description of those singular matrices possessing the triangle property to have tridiagonal Moore-Penrose inverse or group inverse.

Rapid advancements in quantum hardware continue to drive this momentum forward and highlight the fast-paced progress of the field. To facilitate quantum algorithm research, especially as quantum hardware is still maturing, access to robust computational tools is crucial. We introduce QCLAB (\url{https://github.com/QuantumComputingLab/qclab}), an object-oriented MATLAB toolbox for creating, representing and simulating quantum circuits. What sets QCLAB apart is its emphasis on numerical linear algebra, prioritizing numerical stability, efficiency and performance, as well as its seamless integration with MATLAB.
In this talk, featuring a MATLAB tutorial on QCLAB, we will showcase the key features of QCLAB while providing concrete insights into quantum numerical linear algebra through three landmark quantum algorithms: the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), and Quantum Singular Value Estimation (QSVE). This hands-on introduction is intended to encourage the audience to engage actively with this promising research area. With both beginners and experts in mind, the talk is designed for researchers looking for an accessible entry point into quantum computing and experienced practitioners seeking a tool for rapid prototyping of quantum algorithms.

Determining the clique number is an NP-complete problem, which implies that there is no polynomial-time algorithm to solve it. Wilf's inequality provides a spectral bound for the clique number of simple graphs, given by $\frac{n}{n - \lambda_{1}} \leq \omega$, where $\lambda_1$ is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix, and $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph. Strengthening this bound, Elphick and Wocjan proposed a conjecture in 2018 that is $\frac{n}{n - \sqrt{s^{+}}} \leq \omega$, where $s^+ = \sum_{\lambda_{i} > 0} \lambda_{i}^2$ and $\lambda_i$ are eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. In this work, we have settled this conjecture for seven different classes of graphs: (1) Paley graphs which are strongly regular graphs with parameters $srg(4\beta + 1, 2\beta, \beta - 1, \beta)$, where $q$ is a prime power and $q \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$; (2) strongly regular graphs with $\alpha = \beta$ (i.e., $srg(n, d, \beta, \beta)$); (3) the line graph of $K_{m,m}$; (4) the line graph of $K_{n}$; (5) the Cartesian product of strongly regular graphs $G$ with $G$, where $G$ is a strongly regular graph; (6) general Rook's graphs; and (7) Ramanujan graphs, where the second largest eigenvalue follows the property $\lambda_2 \leq 2\sqrt{d-1}$."

 whereas only a little is known for matrices of order $5$ or more except for some sets of doubly structured matrices. 
 %A DS matrix always can be represented as the convex combination of permutation matrices of concerned size.
 
 This talk concerns the following questions: What are those trace zero order $5$ DS matrices whose $k$-times multiplications are also trace zero matrices for some values of $k?$ What is the eigenvalue region of the set of trace zero order $5$ DS matrices? 
 
 We address these questions by proposing a graph theoretic approach to determine the trace of the product of two permutation matrices through a weighted digraph representation for a pair of permutation matrices. Then, we derive the DS matrices of order $5$ whose $k$-th power is also a trace-zero DS matrix for $k\in\{2,3,4,5\}$. Then, we determine necessary conditions for the coefficients of a generic polynomial of degree $5$ to be realizable as the characteristic polynomial of a trace-zero DS matrix of order $5$. Using this, we approximate the eigenvalue region of trace-zero DS matrices of order $5.$

[On nonsingular trees and a reciprocal eigenvalue property, Linear Multilinear Algebra, 54(6)(2006) 453-465] provided a combinatorial description of the inverse of the adjacency matrix for bipartite graphs in terms of $mm$-alternating paths, enabling deeper exploration of bipartite graph properties. However, for non-bipartite graphs, a similar framework remained an open challenge. In 2022, a combinatorial description was established for non-bipartite unicyclic graphs.
This paper advances the understanding of non-bipartite graphs by providing a comprehensive combinatorial description of the inverse of the adjacency matrix for non-bipartite bicyclic graphs, utilizing $mm$-alternating paths between vertices. It further determines the conditions under which the adjacency matrix of a bicyclic graph is unimodular and establishes criteria for the adjacency matrix of a non-bipartite graph to be signable. Additionally, it is definitively shown that the inverse graph of a non-bipartite bicyclic graph remains non-bipartite, reinforcing the structural properties of such graphs.

Token graphs have applications in coding theory and quantum mechanics. It was conjectured that for any graph $G$, the algebraic connectivity of $F_k(G)$ is equal to the algebraic connectivity of $G$. This result turned out to be a theorem, as it was proved by using the theory of the continuous Markov chain of random walks and interchange process. However, proving this theorem using algebraic and combinatorial methods is still an open and interesting problem.

When $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of the matrices whose symmetric part is positive semidefinite, we obtain the so-called non-symmetric positive semidefinite Procrustes (NSPSDP) problem.  The NSPSDP problem arises in the estimation of compliance or stiffness matrix in solid and elastic structures. 
 If $X$ has rank $r$, Baghel et al. in [1] proposed a three-step semi-analytical approach: 
 (1) construct a reduced NSPSDP problem in dimension $r\times r$, 
 (2) solve the reduced problem by means of a fast gradient method with a linear rate of convergence, and 
 (3) post-process the solution of the reduced problem to construct a solution of the larger original NSPSDP problem. We revisit this approach of  Baghel et al.\ and identify an unnecessary assumption used by the authors leading to cases where their algorithm cannot attain a minimum and produces solutions with unbounded norm.  
 In fact, revising the post-processing phase of their semi-analytical approach, we show that the infimum of the NSPSDP problem is always attained, and we show how to compute a minimum-norm solution. We also prove that the symmetric part of the computed solution has minimum rank bounded by $r$, and that the skew-symmetric part has rank bounded by $2r$. Several numerical examples show the efficiency of this algorithm, both in terms of computational speed and of finding optimal minimum-norm solutions.

Completely positive matrix has applications in block designs, complementarity problems and optimization problems.

The dual of the completely positive cone is the copositive cone. These cones are widely studied in copositive programming. It is well known that a positive semidefinite matrix $M$ of size $n$ can be factorized as $M=AA^T$ for some real matrix $A$ of size $n$. The membership problem of the completely positive matrices is proven to be NP-hard.

Many numerical algorithms have been developed to find the efficient solution of the {SPP}  with {{circulant}}, {Toeplitz}, or {symmetric}-{Toeplitz} block matrices. This prompts a natural inquiry: can an approximate solution obtained from a numerical algorithm be the exact solution to a nearly perturbed problem? The concept of backward error ({BE})  is used to determine how far a computed solution stands from the original problem. Recent research efforts have focused on exploring the  BE for SPPs. However, these investigations overlook the inherent sparsity pattern and {{circulant}},  {Toeplitz} or symmetric-Toeplitz structures of the coefficient matrix of the SPP. To overcome these limitations, we investigate the structured  {BEs} of {SPPs} when the perturbation matrices exploit the sparsity pattern as well as { {circulant}},  {Toeplitz}, and  {symmetric}-{Toeplitz} structures. Furthermore, we construct minimal perturbation matrices that preserve the sparsity pattern and the aforementioned structures. One application of the obtained results is discussed in deriving structured  {BEs} for the weighted regularized least squares problem. Numerical experiment are performed to validate our findings, showcasing the utility of the obtained structured  {BEs} in assessing the strong stability of numerical algorithms."

bring out some recent results about the location of right eigenvalues of $P(\lambda)$ 
relative to certain subsets of the set of quaternions. The notion of (hyper)stability of 
complex matrix polynomials is extended to quaternion matrix polynomials and 
results are obtained about right eigenvalues of $P(\lambda)$ by  
$(1)$ giving a relation between (hyper)stability of a quaternion matrix polynomial and 
its complex adjoint matrix polynomial, and then by $(2)$ proving that $P(\lambda)$ is 
stable with respect to an open (closed) ball in the set of quaternions, centered at a complex 
number if and only if it is stable with respect to its intersection with the set of 
complex numbers.  We derive as a consequence of the above that right 
eigenvalues of $P(\lambda)$ lie between two concentric balls of specific radii in the 
set of quaternions centered at the origin. A generalization of the 
Enestr{\""o}m-Kakeya theorem to quaternion matrix polynomials is obtained as an

The main obstacle in deriving eigenvalue algorithms for matrices of quaternions, due to non-cummutativity, is the efficient implementation of shifts. Other linear algebra concepts naturally carry over from real or complex numbers. 
Reduced biquaternions are a four-dimensional commutative number algebra, introduced by Segre in 1892. The main obstacles when deriving algorithms for matrices of reduced biquaternions are the existence of non-invertible non-zero elements, and the need to consistently define some basic linear algebra concepts in this setting. 
We present new efficient algorithms for the QR factorization and eigenvalue and singular value decompositions of these types of matrices and their dual, keeping them as generic as possible. 
We also present applications to computation of various types of matrix generalized inverses and image analysis. The algorithms are efficiently implemented using the multiple-dispatch feature of the programming language Julia.

Given the non-commutative nature of quaternions, we provide a structured analysis of left and right range and null spaces of quaternion matrices. Explicit representations for these inverses are formulated, including full-rank decomposition-based constructions. To facilitate efficient computation, we introduce two distinct algorithms: one utilizing the Quaternion Toolbox for MATLAB (QTFM) and another based on a complex structure-preserving framework. Additionally, we establish a novel link between quaternion outer inverses with subspace constraints and the Moore–Penrose inverse, offering a new perspective on their interrelation. The effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated through numerical experiments, and their practical utility is highlighted via a color image deblurring application.

Notably, the generator $U$ in such an approximation is the pseudoinverse of the rank $r$ projection of the submatrix at the intersection of the selected rows and columns, similar to how maximum projective volume approximations are formed. This allows to view any cross approximation algorithm of a similar form as an approximate projection onto subspace of rank $r$ matrices, and as a faster alternative to randomized approximate SVD. In particular, projections with such cross approximations outperform modern matrix completion algorithms, when the fraction of known elements is high enough.

TT-cross approximation has certain limitations: the tensor's approximation error may be exponentially linked to that of selected submatrices, and determining ranks poses a challenge.

In this talk we introduce the TTCrossOrth algorithm, which optimizes the TT-cross method through error orthogonalization to mitigate exponential error growth and incorporates a novel rank adaptation strategy.

theorem by Aissen, Schoenberg, Whitney and Edrei it happens if and
only if all the zeros of $Q_m$ are real and non-positive.

Distances between parameters are first calculated using a metric defined on the Grassmann manifold of solution subspaces. Then, the K-medoids clustering algorithm is used with these Grassmann distances to categorize the parameters into classes and form a dictionary of local bases. Machine learning techniques based on support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) are finally employed to create classifiers that can automatically determine the most appropriate local basis for constructing reduced-order models.

One possible approach to deal with such systems is via manifold interpolation. In particular, the interpolation of subspaces, i.e., points on the Grassmann manifold has recently received more and more attention.
Basic manifold interpolation requires working with local coordinate charts and can be subdivided into three key steps:\\
1: {\em Preprocessing.} Map sampled data from manifold  to  coordinate domain. \\
2: {\em Interpolation.}
	Employ a Euclidean interpolation method to interpolate the data images in the coordinate domain.\\
3: {\em Postprocessing.} Map interpolated data from coordinate domain to manifold.\\
The gold standard is arguably to work with Riemannian normal coordinates, since in a sense they exhibite the least possible geometric distortion.
Yet, this may become expensive, especially when derivative data is involved.\\
An alternative for the Grassmann manifold are a certain set of local coordinates, which do not require matrix decompositions. Although these have been known for three decades, to our knowledge they have not yet been investigated in detail and have not been used in connection with model reduction.\\
In this talk, we investigate their usability for Grassmann interpolation. We show that this set of coordinates constitutes a retraction. Moreover, we expose the sources of data processing errors and their impact on the interpolation errors. A pivot in these coordinates is an invertible submatrix of an orthogonal projector.
We show how selection of this subblock by volume maximization improves the condition number of the coordinate charts and eventually reduces the interpolation errors.
The results are illustrated by numerical experiments.

for data driven analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems, with a wide spectrum 
of applications. It can be used for model order reduction, analysis of
latent structures in the dynamics, and e.g. for forecasting and control.  The
theoretical bedrock upon which the more general Extended DMD framework 
is built is the Koopman composition operator.
%
DMD can be described as a data driven Rayleigh-Ritz extraction of spectral information
of a Koopman operator associated with the underlying dynamical system. 
The nonlinear data snapshots are represented using the eigenvectors of the
operator resulting in a modal decomposition KMD (Koopman Mode Decomposition).
This becomes a model order reduction tool that represents the nonlinear dynamics
using selected eigenpairs. It can be used to reveal coherent states and for forecasting. \\
In some cases, a numerically computed compression of the Koopman operator exhibits 
high non-normality, and, as a result, the eigenvectors are highly ill-conditioned and the
KMD becomes numerically unstable.
%
We address this problem and introduce a new theoretical and computational framework for
data driven Koopman mode analysis of nonlinear dynamics. The 
problem of ill-conditioned eigenvectors  is solved using a Koopman-Schur 
decomposition that is entirely 
based on unitary transformations. The analysis in terms of the eigenvectors as 
modes of a Koopman operator  is replaced with a modal decomposition 
in terms of a flag of invariant subspaces that correspond to selected eigenvalues.

The main computational tool from the numerical linear algebra is the partial 
ordered Schur decomposition that provides convenient orthonormal bases for these 
subspaces. \\

A common characteristic of many ``real-world'' graphs is a degree distribution that follows an inverse power law. Specifically, the number of vertices with degree $x$ is proportional to $x^\beta$, where $\beta$ typically ranges between 1 and 3. The Chung-Lu model offers a straightforward approach to capturing this power-law behavior in synthetic networks.

We extend the Chung-Lu model to random geometric graphs. In this extension, each vertex is assigned both an expected degree and a random position in Euclidean space according to a probability distribution. Once the vertices are placed, the realization of each edge occurs independently of others. We rigorously establish the conditions necessary to ensure that the assigned degrees align with the expected degrees. This geometric Chung-Lu model is tested on the connectome of the \emph{Drosophila} medulla (fruit fly), where the random model successfully replicates the graph-theoretical structure of the original network, including the eigenvalues of various graph-theoretic matrices.

","Robust subspace recovery (RSR), or outlier-robust PCA, aims to identify a low-dimensional subspace in datasets corrupted by outliers—an essential task for fundamental matrix estimation in computer vision. Despite numerous approaches, RSR faces two main challenges: heuristic methods like RANSAC often outperform mathematically rigorous approaches, and as outlier fractions grow, the problem becomes computationally intractable, with limited theoretical guarantees. We introduce the subspace-constrained Tyler's estimator (STE), which fuses Tyler's M-estimator with the fast median subspace method. Our analysis establishes that STE, when properly initialized, achieves effective subspace recovery even in challenging regimes previously lacking theoretical guarantees. We further demonstrate STE's competitive performance in fundamental matrix estimation and relate it to broader structure-from-motion (SfM) challenges.

","High-dimensional functions and tensors frequently arise in scientific computing and data science, yet their low-rank representations are often obscured by noise and numerical instability. This work addresses the fundamental challenge of constructing accurate and robust tensor train (TT) decompositions without incurring the curse of dimensionality (CoD). We propose an efficient Galerkin interpolative framework that integrates a randomized range-finding strategy with adaptive pivot selection to identify low-dimensional structure in high-order tensors. Our method avoids explicit enumeration of the full tensor and leverages hierarchical structure to construct the TT format with near-optimal complexity. Despite its reduced computational cost, the proposed approach retains competitive accuracy, robustness, and stability compared to state-of-the-art full complexity algorithms. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing low-rank structure across a range of high-dimensional benchmark problems.

For two Hermitian matrices $\rho$ and $\sigma$ in ${\mathbb M}_n$, we write $\rho \geq \sigma$ if $\rho - \sigma \geq 0$, and $\rho > \sigma$ if $\rho - \sigma >0$. This is called the L\""{o}wner partial order for Hermitian matrices.

The matrix $\alpha$-geometric mean of two positive definite matrices $\rho$ and $\sigma$ is defined by
\[
\rho\ \sharp_{\alpha}\ \sigma = \rho^{1/2}(\rho^{-1/2}\sigma \rho^{-1/2})^{\alpha}\rho^{1/2}\qquad \text{for $\alpha \in [0,1]$}.

The geometric structure space $\mathfrak{S}(X)$ of a Banach space $X$ reflects the geometric features of the unit ball $B_X$ of $X$, and is equipped with a closure operator which does not necessarily induce a topology. There is a natural notion of homeomorphisms between (generalized) closure spaces. Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$ are said to have homeomorphic geometric structure spaces, denoted by $X\sim_\mathfrak{S} Y$, if there exists a homeomorphism between $\mathfrak{S} (X)$ and $\mathfrak{S} (Y)$. The classification of Banach spaces with respect to $\sim_\mathfrak{S}$ is strictly coarser (and hence, the results are stronger) than that with respect to the Birkhoff-James equivalence $\sim_{BJ}$.

The purpose of this talk is to present a recent progress on the theory of geometric structure spaces of $C^*$-algebras. In particular, a description of homeomorphisms between the normal parts of geometric structure spaces of $C^*$-algebras acting irreducibly on Hilbert spaces is given.

Furthermore, many dedicated numerical methods have been developed to exploit and preserve the structure of pH systems, e.g. for space- and time-discretization, and model order reduction (MOR).
In our work, we focus on the structure-preserving MOR of linear time-varying (LTV) pH systems. LTV systems appear quite naturally in many applications, e.g. in the linearization of nonlinear systems around non-stationary reference solutions, or when some of the system parameters are time-dependent.
In this talk we introduce a general approach based on (Petrov)-Galerkin projection for the structure-preserving MOR of LTV-pH systems. This includes (but is not limited to) the extension of the effort constraint method to LTV-pH systems. Furthermore, we combine balancing and projection to obtain a reduced model that is guaranteed to be pH. We exhibit numerical experiments to validate our algorithms.

high-fidelity compact models to approximate physical phenomena when explicit
models, such as state-space formulations with access to internal variables, are
not available yet abundant input/output data are.
When deriving models from theoretical principles, the results
typically contain differential structures that lead to certain system
properties.
A common example are dynamical systems with second-order time derivatives
like
\begin{equation*}
  M \ddot{x}(t) + D \dot{x}(t) + K x(t) = B u(t), \quad
  y(t) = C x(t),
\end{equation*}
arising in the modeling of mechanical or electro-mechanical processes.
In this case, data are often available in the frequency domain, where the
systems' input-to-output behavior is described by rational functions
of the form
\begin{equation*}
  H(s) = C (s^{2} M + s D + K)^{-1} B,
\end{equation*}
rather than differential equations.
Classical frequency domain approaches like the Loewner framework, vector
fitting and AAA are available and can be used to learn unstructured
(first-order) models from data.
However, these models in their original formulation do not reflect the
structure-inherited properties.
The key element in the derivation of frequency domain approaches is the
barycentric form of rational functions.
In this work, we present a structured extension of the barycentric form for the
case of mechanical systems.
This structured barycentric form is given by
\begin{equation*}
  \widehat{H}(s) = \left(\sum_{j = 1}^k\frac{h_{j} w_{j}}{(s - \lambda_{j})
    (s - \sigma_{j})} \right) \left/ \left(1 + \sum_{j = 1}^{k}
    \frac{w_{j}}{(s - \lambda_{j})(s - \sigma_{j})}\right)\right.;
\end{equation*}
see~\cite{WernerSWR_GosGW24}.
Building on this structured rational function representation, we develop new
algorithms for learning reduced-order models of mechanical phenomena in the
frequency domain, while enforcing the mechanical system structure in the model
description.

We test the new algorithms on several problems arising in studying damped vibrational systems and analyzing output synchronization problems for multi-agent systems.

The number of available samples is often far less than the dimension of the underlying state space, making it necessary to impose a regularizing structural assumption such as spatial localization. This talk will examine the use of hierarchical rank structure as a regularizing assumption for high-dimensional covariance estimation. Whereas spatial localization assumes that long-range correlations are near-zero, hierarchical rank structure corresponds to the situation where long-range correlations vary more smoothly than short-range ones. We will first examine, from theoretical and empirical circumstances, the conditions under which this assumption is appropriate. We will then present algorithms and experiments which show how to estimate a high-dimensional covariance matrix from limited samples by imposing hierarchical rank structure. Covariance matrices associated with turbulent fluid dynamics, numerical weather prediction models, and Lorenz-type systems will serve as illustrative examples throughout.

or a reciprocal matrix if it is positive and $a_{ij}=\frac{1}{%
a_{ji}},$ for all $i,j=1,\ldots ,n.$ If, in addition, $a_{ik}a_{kj}=a_{ij}$ for
all $i,j,k,$ the matrix is said to be consistent. Such a matrix is of the
form $ww^{(-T)}$ for some positive vector $w$, in which $w^{(-T)}$ is the transpose of the entrywise
inverse of $w$.

PC matrices play an important role in decision making, namely in models for ranking
alternatives, as the Analytic Hierarchy Process,  proposed by Saaty (1977). 
In these models, a PC matrix represents independent, pairwise, ratio
comparisons among $n$ alternatives and a cardinal ranking vector should be
obtained from it. The consistent matrix constructed from this vector should
be a good approximation of the PC matrix. So, it is desirable to choose a
ranking vector from the set of efficient vectors, as, otherwise, there would
be a positive vector such that the consistent matrix constructed from it
better approximates the PC matrix in at least one entry and is not worse in
all other entries. 

It is known that a positive vector $w$ is efficient for a PC matrix $A$ if
and only if a certain directed graph associated with $A$ and $w$ is strongly
connected. Based on this result, here we give a description of the set of
efficient vectors for a PC matrix as a union of a finite number of
convex sets and discuss some of its consequences. In particular, tight lower
and upper bound matrices for the consistent matrix constructed from an
efficient vector are given.

This independence from the tree structure has been verified for many different variants of weighted bi-directed trees. In my talk (over an arbitrary commutative ring):
\begin{enumerate}
 \item I will present a general setting which strictly subsumes every known variant, and where we show that $\det(D_T)$ - as well as another graph invariant, the cofactor-sum - depends only on the edge-data, not the tree-structure.

 \item We explain why our result is the ``most general possible'', in that allowing greater freedom in the parameters leads to dependence on the tree-structure.

In our setting, the matrices \(A_n\) are composed of (block rectangular) Toeplitz blocks defined by rectangular \(s \times t\) matrix-valued generating functions, and can be viewed as a generalization of classical GLT (Generalized Locally Toeplitz) sequences. Under mild assumptions on the block dimensions, the asymptotic distribution of the singular values of the associated matrix sequences is recently known. Moreover, when the singular value symbol is Hermitian, the spectral symbol coincides with the singular value symbol. Starting from the tools used to determine this singular value distribution, we develop a general preconditioning framework to construct simplified block matrices that approximate the original matrices. These simplified matrices offer two key advantages:\\
1. They maintain the same singular value distributions as \(\{A_n\}_{n}\); \\
2. They enable the solution of linear systems in \(\mathcal{O}(n \log n)\) arithmetic operations.\\
In this way, we propose a natural preconditioning strategy for linear systems with coefficient matrix \(A_n\). We provide detailed singular value and spectral analyses of the preconditioned matrix sequences and validate our approach through numerical experiments concerning the convergence of various (preconditioned) Krylov solvers.

Then, by leveraging Generalized Locally Toeplitz (GLT) theory, we develop a novel preconditioning strategy that involves centrosymmetric preconditioners, such as those derived from the $\tau$ algebra. This approach constitutes a general framework, as it relies solely on the generating function of the Toeplitz matrix, provided that it is defined. We extend all theoretical results to both the multilevel and block settings and demonstrate their effectiveness through numerical experiments on space-fractional diffusion equations, providing several examples to critically evaluate the performance of the proposed preconditioners.

The equation under consideration incorporates a Caputo fractional derivative in space and a tempered fractional derivative in time, both of order between 0 and 1. These types of equations are particularly relevant in various applied fields. To numerically approximate the regularized problem, we employ a finite difference scheme, which results in a large-scale two-by-two block linear system. The study presents theoretical insights into the spectral properties of both non-preconditioned and preconditioned matrix sequences, using tools from Toeplitz and Generalized Locally Toeplitz (GLT) theory. Notably, the preconditioner, derived from the GLT framework, is introduced and analyzed here for the first time in this context. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical findings, followed by concluding remarks."

The \emph{triangle number} of the pattern is the largest $k$ such that some $k\times k$ submatrix is (up to permutation) triangular with only $*$ entries on its diagonal.


A \emph{realization} of the pattern over some field is a matrix that can be obtained by replacing each $*$ entry of the pattern with a nonzero value from that field.
The smallest rank of such a realization is the \emph{minimum rank} of the pattern (over that field).  The triangle number provides a natural and simple lower bound on this value.

This talk explores some different combinatorial angles on the triangle number.  For example, we review how the triangle number is connected with the zero forcing number, both for simple graphs and directed graphs.  In fact, the bound it provides on the minimum rank of a pattern is closely related to the bound given by the zero forcing number on the maximum nullity of a graph; we see how, in certain special cases, the relationship is especially strong.  This also motivates the question of Nordhaus-Gaddum type bounds for the triangle number, and we present some recent results on this front.  We also examine the triangle number through the lens of lattice theory and matroid theory, where it provides a lower bound on a related class of minimum rank problems for matroids, one which can provide insights into the original minimum rank problem for matrix patterns.

An important activity in the field of spectral graph theory is the characterization of graphs by their spectrum. Hence, switching provides a tool for disproving the existence of such a characterization. 

In this talk we will overview recent progress on switching methods for the construction of cospectral graphs. Work by Wang and Xu (2010) suggests that most cospectral graphs with cospectral complements can be constructed using regular orthogonal matrices of level 2, which has relevance for Haemers' conjecture. In this direction, we will present two new switching methods based on regular orthogonal matrices of level 2. We will also show a general framework for counting the number of graphs that have a non-isomorphic cospectral graph through any of the existing switching methods for the adjacency matrix, expanding on the work by Haemers and Spence (2004).

\begin{equation*}
U(t)=\exp({\mathrm{i}tA}),\quad t\in\mathbb{R}
\end{equation*}
which is unitary for each $t\in\mathbb{R}$. If we write $A=S^TDS$ where $D=\operatorname{diag}(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n)$ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of $A$ and $S$ is an orthogonal matrix, then the above equation can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{1}
U(t)=S^Te^{\mathrm{i}tD}S,

where $e^{\mathrm{i}tD}=\operatorname{diag}(e^{\mathrm{i}t\lambda_1},\ldots,e^{\mathrm{i}t\lambda_n})$. We say that $X$ admits \textit{uniform mixing} at time $\tau$ if all entries of $U(\tau)$ have equal magnitude. Uniform mixing symbolizes maximal entanglement amongst all qubits in a graph representing a quantum spin network - a phenomenon that is useful in the theory of quantum information and computation.

To apportion a complex matrix means to apply a similarity so that all entries of the resulting matrix have the same magnitude. The study of matrix apportionment was initiated by Leslie and three of her collaborators in a 2024 LAA paper. From (\ref{1}), the existence of uniform mixing at time $\tau$ is equivalent to $U(\tau)$ being apportionable.  

In this talk, we survey old and new results on uniform mixing, and explore its connections to matrix apportionment. Some results in this talk are joint work with Steve Kirkland and Sarah Plosker.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for constructing a nested sequence of homogeneous Riemannian manifolds. Common examples of homogeneous Riemannian manifolds include the spheres, the Stiefel manifolds, and the Grassmann manifolds. In particular, we focus on applying the proposed framework to the Grassmann manifolds, giving rise to the nested Grassmannians (NG). An important application in which Grassmann manifolds are encountered is planar shape analysis. Specifically, each planar (2D) shape can be represented as a point in the complex projective space which is a complex Grassmann manifold. Some salient features of our framework are: (i) it explicitly exploits the geometry of the homogeneous Riemannain manifolds and (ii) the nested lower-dimensional submanifolds need not be geodesic. With the proposed NG structure, we develop algorithms for the supervised and unsupervised dimensionality reduction problems respectively. The proposed algorithms are compared with PGA via simulation studies and real data experiments and are shown to achieve a higher ratio of expressed variance compared to PGA.

In this study, we leverage Tucker decomposition for the completion of motion capture (MoCap) data, which is inherently multi-dimensional and characterized by complex temporal dependencies. MoCap data often suffers from gaps due to missing markers during the recording process, leading to the need for efficient and accurate gap-filling methods. We propose two gap-filling algorithms based on Tucker decomposition: Tucker and TuckerTNN. These methods exploit the low-rank properties of MoCap tensors. To address the computational challenges associated with traditional smoothness regularization, we introduce a temporal nuclear norm regularization in the TuckerTNN model, which provides a more efficient solution for large-scale MoCap datasets.

Our method utilizes Hutchinson's stochastic trace estimator together with the Lanczos algorithm to approximate quadratic forms involving spectral projectors.\\
Instead of focusing on determining the gap between two particular consecutive eigenvalues of $A$, we aim to find all gaps that are wider than a specified threshold. By examining the problem from this perspective, and thoroughly analyzing both the Hutchinson and the Lanczos components of the algorithm, we obtain error bounds that allow us to determine the numbers of Hutchinson's sample vectors and Lanczos iterations needed to ensure the detection of all gaps above the target width with high probability.\\
We conclude that the most efficient strategy is to always use a single random sample vector for Hutchinson's estimator and concentrate all computational effort in the Lanczos algorithm. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of this approach.

First, we approximate \( -(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \) as the fractional power of a discretized Laplacian using the Matrix Transfer Technique and represent the result in integral form via the Dunford-Taylor integral representation. Various quadrature rules are then explored to approximate the integral, leading to rational approximations of the fractional power operator.  
This approach enables us to construct preconditioners expressed as a sum of \( m \) inverses of shifted Laplacian matrices, where \( m \) depends on the chosen quadrature scheme. For \(\alpha\) close to $2$, it is well known that the Laplacian itself serves as an effective preconditioner with linear computational cost. However, as \(\alpha\) decreases toward 1, its performance deteriorates, requiring more specialized approaches. Using Gauss-Jacobi quadrature, we show that our preconditioner significantly improves performance for \(\alpha\) close to $1$, even with a modest \( m \), while maintaining the same computational complexity as the Laplacian.  
To further enhance efficiency, we investigate the use of exponentially convergent quadrature rules to minimize the number of required inverses while achieving optimal preconditioning performance. Specifically, we examine both sinc and Gauss-Laguerre quadratures and demonstrate that, with appropriate parameter tuning, both approaches outperform the Gauss-Jacobi one, ensuring numerical optimality."

Exponential integrators form a popular class of such methods since they are provably robust to stiffness and have been successfully applied to a variety of problems. On the other hand, the dynamical low-rank approximation is a recent technique for solving high-dimensional differential equations by means of low-rank approximations. However, the domain is lacking numerical methods for stiff equations since existing methods are either not robust-to-stiffness or have unreasonably large hidden constants. \newline

More generally, the number and relative positions of the nonnegative roots of $p(-x)$ and $q(-x)$ determine the number of roots of $f$ which lie in the left (or right) half-plane.

","Identifying quantum channels clarifies how quantum states evolve and how information propagates. Because exact reconstruction is NP‑hard, we focus on efficient numerical approximations.

Exploiting the unitary nature of channel dynamics, we cast the problem on the Stiefel manifold—the intrinsic geometric space of real or complex unitary matrices---to devise practical reconstruction algorithms.

\textbf{Part I -- Single-unitary channels} \\
\noindent When the channel is generated by a single unitary operator, we combine polar decomposition with manifold geometry to achieve exact recovery and delineate the minimal data requirements.

that is important for both theory and applications. 
It consists of a plus or minus sign associated to each elementary divisor

these $\pm$ signs are invariants under unimodular congruence.
Motivated by the generic eigenstructure problem
for Hermitian matrix polynomials,
it is natural to consider the special scenario 
when all eigenvalues are simple.
In this case these signs can be naturally ordered to form a \emph{sign sequence}. 
 For an $n \times n$ Hermitian polynomial of degree $d$
with $dn$ simple real eigenvalues, for example, 
there are $2^{dn}$ possible sign sequences.
However, most of these sign sequences 
cannot be realized by any degree $d$ \,Hermitian polynomial. 
Is it possible to characterize exactly which sign sequences 
are realizable and which are not? 
And does the degree play any role in the story?

This talk completely settles these questions, 
discussing several new constraints on signs 
beyond the well-known signature constraint (1),
clarifying the dichotomy between even and odd degrees 
in the characterization,
as well as describing an underlying group of symmetries 
on the collection of all sign sequences

this characterization of realizable sign sequences enables a complete solution

From real life to mathematical challenges,"In signal processing the time-frequency analysis of nonlinear and non-stationary processes, as well as the determination of the unknown number of active sub-signals of a blind-source composite signal are, in general, challenging inverse problem tasks. If we consider data sampled on a sphere, things get even more complicated. This is the reason why just a few techniques have been developed so far to study this kind of data. However, many real-life data are of this nature, like in Geophysics and Physics.

The idea is to extend the Iterative Filtering (IF) algorithm to work on the sphere. IF is a non-stationary signal decomposition method proposed a decade ago [1] to address the problem of extracting time-varying oscillatory components from a non-stationary multicomponent signal. This method proved to be really valuable in many applications, see [2] and references therein, and it was accelerated in what is known as Fast Iterative Filtering (FIF) [3] by leveraging the Toeplitz matrix theory.

In this talk, we introduce the generalization of IF to handle spherical data and show how we can address the question about its convergence [4]. We conclude with some examples of application to geophysical data.

","The theory of Generalised Locally Toeplitz (GLT) Sequences, see for example \cite{garoni171}, has been successfully used to study the spectra of different classes of Toeplitz(-like) matrix sequences such as Hermitian, non-Hermitian, block-valued, variable coefficient, etc. Specifically, it is a tool that allows us to approximate the eigenvalues of Hermitian Toeplitz(-like) matrices by sampling a function, called the symbol, using an equispaced grid. GLT theory has also been extended to include the concept of momentary symbols, that is, symbols which change depending on the size of the matrix, see \cite{Bolten2022}. This is particularly useful in the case of, for example, PDE discetisations of some  operators which may have some variety of grid size \(h\) in the symbol that would change depending on the matrix size, that is, it would change with refinement.
The Matrix-less method, see \cite{ekstrom2018matrix,expmathmlm,ekstromreal, variablecoef}, aims to use the inherent structure of Toeplitz matrices to accurately compute the spectrum of a much larger matrix in the sequence using a number of (much) smaller matrices. It computes so called ``higher-order'' symbols, and then using an interpolation-extrapolation scheme allow it to approximate the eigenvalues with much higher accuracy.
We show that these methods, which approximate the eigenvalues of the operator, are able to cheaply approximate the trace of different matrix functions without having to actually construct the (potentially very large) matrix or do any computations on it. We investigate computing the traces of matrix functions such as \(\mathrm{Tr}\left(e^{-\beta \mathbf{A}}\right),~\mathrm{Tr}\left(\mathbf{A}e^{-\beta \mathbf{A}}\right),~-\mathrm{Tr}\left(\mathbf{A}\log\left(\mathbf{A}\right)\right)\) and others, where \(\mathbf{A}\) is the Toeplitz(-like) linear operator.

A tree cover of $G$ is a collection of  vertex-disjoint simple trees occurring as induced subgraphs of $G$ that together cover all the vertices of $G$. The tree cover number of $G$, denoted $T(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a tree cover. We give a characterization of connected outerplanar graphs whose tree cover number equals the upper bound of $\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$.  We also present results on tree cover number of graph with girth at least 5. In 2011, [Barioli et al., Minimum semidefinite rank of outerplanar graphs and the tree cover number, {\em Elec. J. Lin. Alg.,} 2011] introduced the tree cover number as a tool for studying the maximum nullity of a family of matrices associated with a graph:  Let $\mathcal{S}_+(G)$ denote the set of real positive semidefinite matrices $A=(a_{ij})$ such that for $i\neq j$, $a_{ij}\neq 0$ if $\{i,j\}\in E$ and $a_{ij}=0$ if $\{i,j\}\notin E$. The positive semidefinite maximum  nullity of $G$, denoted $M_+(G),$ is $\max\{\text{null}(A)|A\in \mathcal{S}_+(G)\}.$ It was conjectured in 2011 that $T(G) \le \mathrm{M}_+(G)$ holds for all graphs, and shown that equality holds when $G$ is outerplanar.  Therefore our bounds on $T(G)$ give bounds on $M_+(G)$ for outerplanar graphs. We show that the conjecture $T(G)\leq M_+(G)$ is true for certain other graph families.

Similarly, the minimum rank problem for a simple graph is to find the smallest
rank of a symmetric matrix whose off-diagonal nonzero entries occur according
to the edges of a given graph.  In each case, a fundamental combinatorial lower
bound exists; for the former, it is the triangle number of the pattern, while
for the latter it is the zero forcing number of the graph.  For a given
zero-nonzero pattern, there exists an associated cobipartite graph.  In
previous work, the minimum rank of the pattern and the maximum nullity of its
associated cobipartite graph were shown to obey a simple relationship; each is
equal to the number of vertices in the graph minus the other.  We show that the
corresponding bounds (that of the triangle number and the zero forcing number)

understanding when the triangle number is equal to the minimum rank of a

","Combinatorial matrix theory has found applications in various fields, particularly in spectral graph theory, which has many connections to areas such as chemistry and network analysis. Some of the well-studied objects in this context include the adjacency matrix, Laplacian matrix, signless Laplacian, and distance matrix. More recently, since 2013 and 2021, the eccentricity and neighborhood matrices, respectively, have garnered significant attention due  to several influential articles. A key aspect of spectral graph theory is identifying graphs that can be characterized by their matrix spectrum. We will present recent developments in the study of eccentricity and neighborhood matrices for special classes of graphs, including products of graphs, regular graphs, and multipartite graphs, among others. 

The eccentricity matrix of a connected graph $G$ is derived from its distance matrix by retaining only the largest nonzero entries in each row and column, setting all other entries to zero. This class of matrix was introduced as an application of graph theory to chemical structures.  It is well known that, unlike the distance and the adjacency matrix, the eccentricity matrix is not irreducible for all connected graphs, making it an important problem to identify classes of graphs for which it is irreducible. In this talk, we  investigate various properties of eccentricity matrix and their spectral characteristics. Expanding the scope, we delve into the irreducibility and spectrum of eccentricity matrix for some well-known families of \textit{distance-regular graphs}. 

The neighborhood matrix $\mathcal{NM}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is a graph matrix obtained by the product of adjacency and the Laplacian matrix and is also defined using the neighborhood sets of vertices of $G$. We show that the neighborhood matrix of a connected graph is irreducible.  We determine the $\mathcal{NM}$-eigenvalues of a complete multipartite graph and find that they are always real and non-positive. Moreover, the $\mathcal{NM}$-energy of a complete multipartite graph is twice the number of edges. Further, we show that no two complete multipartite graphs are $\mathcal{NM}$-cospectral.

are the adjacency matrix and the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees
of $G$, respectively. The largest eigenvalue of $A_{\alpha}(G)$ is
called the $A_\alpha$-index of $G$. Chang and Tam (2023) have solved
the problem of determining graphs with maximal $A_{\alpha}$-index
over $\mathcal{G}(n,m)$, the class of graphs with $n$ vertices and
$m$ edges, for $\alpha \in [\frac{1}{2},1)$ and $1\le m\le 2n-3$. In

$\mathcal{G}(n,m)$ that maximize the $A_{\alpha}$-index for $0<

$m\le n-1$ is equivalent to the problem of characterizing graphs

pose the following conjecture: Let $m\ge 3$ be a positive integer

a real number $\alpha_0$, $\alpha_0=\frac{1}{2}$ for $m=3$ and
$\alpha_0\in [0,\frac{1}{2})$ for $m\ge 4$, such that for any
$\alpha \in [0,1)$, $C^m_{d+1}$ (replaced by $K_d$, in case $t=0$),
where $C^m_n$ denotes the quasi-complete graph with $n$ vertices and
$m$ edges, or $K_{1,m}$ is the unique connected graph with $m$ edges
that maximize the $A_{\alpha}$-index over $\mathscr{S}(m)$,
depending on whether $\alpha\in [0,\alpha_0)$ or $\alpha\in
(\alpha_0,1)$; when $\alpha = \alpha_0$, there are exactly two
connected graphs that maximize the $A_{\alpha}$-index over
$\mathscr{S}(m)$, namely, $C^m_{d+1}$ (or $K_d$, in case $t=0$) and
$K_{1,m}$. The conjecture is established when $t=0$.

Algebraic linearizations reduce a matrix polynomial $\mathbf{P}(z) \in \mathbb{C}[z]^{r \times r}$ of degree $s$ into a generalized eigenvalue problem of the form
\begin{equation*}
    (z\mathbf{D_L} - \mathbf{L})\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0} \>,
\end{equation*}
where $\mathbf{D_L}$ is block diagonal, $\mathbf{L}$ is block upper Hessenberg, and $\mathbf{P}(z)$ is reconstructed through a resolvent representation:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{P}(z)^{-1} = \mathbf{X_L}(z\mathbf{D_L} - \mathbf{L})^{-1}\mathbf{Y_L} \>.
\end{equation*}
While algebraic linearizations offer a structured and efficient way to solve polynomial eigenvalue problems, the resulting linearized systems can become computationally demanding for large-scale problems. To overcome this challenge, we incorporate the divide-and-conquer technique, as outlined by Bini and Pan (1992), leveraging its ability to break down eigenvalue computation into smaller, independent subproblems.

We demonstrate how this integration facilitates the efficient computation of eigenvalues for systems such as
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{h}(z) = z\mathbf{a}(z)\mathbf{d}_0\mathbf{b}(z) + \mathbf{c}_0 \>,
\end{equation*}
where $\mathbf{a}(z)$ and $\mathbf{b}(z)$ are matrix polynomials with their own linearizations. This combined approach reduces computational complexity while maintaining numerical stability, making it a scalable and practical solution for large-scale polynomial eigenvalue problems. This talk will highlight the theoretical framework and discuss how this integration enhances the efficiency and robustness of algebraic linearizations.

ISM employs a two-level iterative structure: an outer iteration that updates the estimated index set of the nonzero components in the solution, and an inner iteration that solves associated subproblems to refine the solution within this index set. A key feature of ISM is that the objective function value decreases monotonically across iterations, ensuring that the index sets do not repeat and the optimal solution is reached in finitely many steps. The dominant computational cost lies in solving normal equations during the inner iterations. We also present numerical results to demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of the proposed method, supporting our theoretical findings.

The algorithm that we propose combines the Lanczos method for $f(A) b$ with a basis compression procedure involving rational Krylov subspaces, which is employed whenever the basis grows beyond a certain size in order to reduce memory usage. 
This method has essentially the same convergence behaviour as Lanczos, with the addition of an error term that depends on rational approximation of the function $f$ and is typically negligible. 
The cost of the basis compression procedure is also negligible with respect to the cost of the Lanczos algorithm. In particular, the rational Krylov subspaces used for the compression of the Lanczos basis are built using small projected matrices, so their construction is cheap and does not require the expensive solution of linear systems with the matrix $A$. 
Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits competitive performance when compared against other low-memory methods for $f(A) b$.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:lyap}
AX + XA = \boldsymbol{c}\boldsymbol{c}^T,    
\end{equation}
where $A$ is a large-scale symmetric positive-definite matrix and $\boldsymbol{c}$ is a vector. 

The classical Lanczos method consists in building an orthonormal basis $\mathbf{Q}_M$ for the polynomial Krylov subspace
\[ \mathcal{K}_M(A,\boldsymbol{c}) = span(\boldsymbol{c},A\boldsymbol{c}, \dots, A^{M-1}\boldsymbol{c}) \]
and in approximating the solution $X$ with $\mathbf{Q}_MX_M\mathbf{Q}_M^T$, where $X_M$ solves the projected equation
\[ \mathbf{Q}_M^TA\mathbf{Q}_M X_M + X_M\mathbf{Q}_M^TA\mathbf{Q}_M = \| \boldsymbol{c} \|_F^2\boldsymbol{e}_1\boldsymbol{e}_1^T.\]
The Lanczos algorithm often requires a relatively large $M$ to obtain a good approximation of the solution, which can lead to memory issues due to the storage demands of $\mathbf{Q}_M$. Furthermore, the solution $X$ can be well approximated by a low-rank matrix, whose rank is significantly smaller than $M$, i.e. the dimension of the polynomial Krylov subspace. 

An alternative approach is to use a rational Krylov subspace instead of a polynomial one. Using the Zolotarev poles as the poles of the rational Krylov subspace, it is possible to approximate the solution $X$ by a low-rank matrix with the guarantee that the residual has norm smaller than a prescribed quantity [$2$]. The rank of the computed approximate solution is usually close to the numerical rank of the real solution. The main drawback is that this method requires solving multiple shifted linear systems involving the matrix $A$, which is prohibitive if $A$ is large. 

Mimicking the approach in [$3$], our method employs a polynomial Krylov subspace to approximate the solution of \eqref{eqn:lyap} while leveraging rational Krylov subspaces associated with small matrices to compress the Lanczos basis. This method accesses $A$ only through matrix-vector products and requires the storage of only a few vectors from the polynomial Krylov subspace instead of the entire Lanczos basis, producing an approximate solution whose rank is independent of the dimension of the involved polynomial Krylov subspace.

The computational cost of the proposed algorithm is dominated by the construction of the Lanczos basis, and the compression steps do not require additional matrix-vector products involving $A$. Furthermore, theoretical results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves an approximation error comparable to that of the standard Lanczos algorithm, with an additional error term that can be bounded a priori using Zolotarev numbers. In practice, this additional error is negligible compared to the Lanczos error.

Numerical experiments show that the behavior of the proposed algorithm is comparable to that of the Lanczos algorithm without reorthogonalization, both in terms of matrix-vector products and quality of the approximated solution. Comparisons with existing low-memory variants of the Lanczos method demonstrate competitive performance in terms of accuracy, computational cost, and runtime.

They are pivotal in solving large, sparse linear systems \( A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} \), computing select eigenvalues and eigenvectors of expansive sparse matrices \( A \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v} \), evaluating matrix-function vector products \( \mathbf{y} = f(A) \mathbf{x} \), and resolving linear matrix equations with low-rank right-hand sides \( A X + X B^T = UV^T \).
In contemporary computational science, ``large-scale'' denotes problems involving sparse matrices with millions to billions of unknowns. Addressing such complexities necessitates leveraging supercomputers and implementing distributed-memory versions of Krylov-based algorithms.

Building on prior results~\cite{ahmad2025matrix}, we now investigate whether the assumption of invertibility of the GLT symbols almost everywhere is essential. Motivated by the fact that inversion is often required due to matrix non-commutativity, we explore the scenario where the symbols commute, aiming to relax the invertibility condition. Furthermore, we study the Karcher mean of more than two HPD GLT matrix-sequences, focusing on how an initial guess that itself belongs to the GLT algebra influences the convergence of the iterative computation. Numerical experiments support our theoretical claims and demonstrate improved convergence behavior under structured initialization.

Finally, we extend the theoretical results to the multilevel block case (for $r = 1$, $d \geq 1$), offering a a broader generalization and deeper numerical validation.

To prepare our post Covid students we need to use interactive teaching methods and inversely taught syllabi which are slowly creating  grass roots fire among students and catching instructors as well. Such courses follow the Teaching Principles of Jean Piaget from 80 years ago who established that we only learn deeply and retain what we need to understand, and not what we are taught to pass a test. Such a course in elementary Linear Algebra can be designed from only two mathematical  principles : the Row Echelon Form Reduction teaches us of the value of pivot searches and  Krylov Vector Iterations that allow us an inside look at intrinsic matrix qualities such as eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Both of these rely on Riesz's Theorem on Matrix Representations of Linear Functions in varying vector space bases. Students should build their own basic codes to perform reliable algorithms for these essential tasks of modern Linear Algebra as it is used everywhere in our internet, cell-phone and computer worlds and in Engineering, Medicine, Shipping, Traveling, Banking and so forth.
Such a course would follow the Piaget Principle of deep learning.

","The main challenge in teaching linear algebra, or mathematics in general, in Taiwan is the lack of motivation. Many students have been conditioned to view learning as solely a means to achieve good exam scores, while higher education should focus on more than just grades. Hands-on activities can help spark students' interest in learning. In this talk, we will present several collaborative tasks that encourage students to work and learn together.

We will explore the connection between the spectral properties of an  $\mathrm{AFD}_+$-matrix $A$ and the spectral properties of a limit point $L$ of its stochastic roots. This connection, which is first formalised in the broader context of complex and real square matrices, poses restrictions on $A$ assuming $L$ is given. For example, if an $\mathrm{AFD}_+$-matrix $A$ has a corresponding irreducible limit point $L$, then $A$ has to be a circulant matrix. We close with a complete characterisation of $\mathrm{AFD}_+$-matrices of rank-two."

The Johnson and Hamming graphs are well-studied families of graphs with many interesting combinatorial and algebraic properties. We prove that every Johnson graph admits a signed adjacency matrix with exactly two distinct eigenvalues, establishing that its $q$-value is two.

","Let $p$ and $q$ be two discrete probability distributions, that is, $p=(p_1, \dots, p_n)$, $q = (q_1, \dots, q_n)$ are $n$-vectors with nonnegative coordinates such that $\sum_{i=1}^np_i = \sum_{i=1}^nq_i = 1$. The Hellinger distance $d_H$ between $p$ and $q$ is the Euclidean norm of the difference between the squre roots of $p$ and $q$; 
$$
d(p,q) = \|\sqrt{p}-\sqrt{q}\|^2 = \left[\sum_{i=1}^n(\sqrt{p_i}-\sqrt{q_i})^2\right]^{1/2}
 = \left[\sum_{i=1}^n(p_i+q_i) -2\sum_{i=1}^n\sqrt{p_iq_i}\right]^{1/2}.
$$
and define $d_H(p, q) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}d(p,q) = \sqrt{{\rm Tr} \mathcal{A}(p,q) - {\rm Tr}\mathcal{G}(p,q)}$, where 
$\mathcal{A}(p,q)$ is the arithmetic mean of the vectors $p,q$, $\mathcal{G}(p,q)$ is their geometric mean.  

A matrix version of the Hellinger distance is extended on the set %$\mathcal{P}_n$ 
of $n \times n$   density matrices $A$ and $B$ such that $A, B > 0$ and ${\rm Tr}(A) = {\rm Tr}(B) = 1$ as follows:
$$
\widetilde{d_H}(A, B) = \left[{\rm Tr}\left(\frac{A + B}{2}\right) - {\rm Tr}(A\sharp B)\right]^{1/2} 
= \left[{\rm Tr}(A\nabla B) - {\rm Tr}(A\sharp B)\right]^{1/2} ,
$$
where $A \sharp B = A^{1/2}(A^{-1/2}BA^{-1/2})^{1/2}A^{1/2}$ is called the geometric mean of $A$ and $B$.
Note that $\widetilde{d_H}$ does not satisfy the triangle inequality in the metric axioms and when $AB = BA$, ${\rm Tr}(A \sharp B) = {\rm Tr}(A^{1/2}B^{1/2})$.  In \cite{BGJ  2019}

as in \cite[Sects 1.2 and 1.3]{SA 2016}.
%:A smooth function $\Phi$ from $\mathcal{P}_n \times \mathcal{P}_n$ to the set of nonnegative real numbers $\R_+$ is called a divergence if

In this talk we present the extended version of the above divergence as follows:

Let $\lambda \in (0, 1)$ and $\sigma$ be an operator mean in the sense of Kubo-Ando \cite{KA 1980} such that $!_\lambda \leq \sigma < \nabla_\lambda$. Let $g:[0,\infty) \rightarrow [0,\infty)$ be strictly increasing function such that $g^{-1}$ is operator monotone function on $(0, \infty)$. Then the quantity $\Phi_{g,\sigma}(X,Y) = {\rm Tr}(g(X\nabla_\lambda Y))-g(X\sigma Y))$ is a quantum divergence for $X,Y \in \mathcal{P}_n$.

","Let $A$ be an  $m\times n$ real matrix. If the  manifold  consisting of all matrices orthogonally equivalent to $A$ and the manifold consisting of all real matrices having the same sign pattern as $A$ (both considered as embedded submanifolds of $\mathbb R^{m \times n}$),  intersect transversally at $A$, we say that $A$ has the \emph{orthogonal equivalence transversality property} (OETP) and that $A$ is an OETP matrix. By examining the tangent spaces, it can be seen that $A$ has the OETP iff as $S$ and $K$ run over all $m\times m$ and $n\times n$ skew-symmetric matrices, the matrices $AS + KA$ can attain independent and arbitrary values at the positions where the corresponding entries of $A$ are equal to  zero.  Using the normal spaces, it can be shown that $A$ has the OETP iff $X=0$ is the only matrix satisfying the following three conditions $A\circ X=0,$ $AX^T$ is symmetric, and $X^TA$ is symmetric. Many fundamental facts about the OETP matrices are presented. For instance, if $A$ is an OETP matrix, then every superpattern of sgn$(A)$ allows a matrix orthogonally equivalent  to $A$. The direct sum of two square matrices $B$ and $C$ has the OETP iff both $B$ and $C$ have the OETP, and $B$ and $C$ do not have any common singular value.        
The bidiagonal  zero-nonzero pattern with all entries on the diagonal and  the first superdiagonal nonzero requires the OETP.

the existence of the maximal solution to the CDARE with a nonsingular control weighting matrix within
the framework of a constructive method. Our contribution to the work is to find another meaningful
Hermitian solution, which has received little attention in the existing literature. Moreover, we show that
certain extremal solutions cannot be attained simultaneously, and almost (anti-)stabilizing solutions coincide
with some extremal solutions. We expect that our theoretical results presented in this paper will play an
important role in optimal control problems for discrete-time antilinear systems.

Under mild and reasonable assumptions, the existence of the maximal solution to the conjugate discrete-time Riccati equation, in which the control weighting matrix is nonsingular and its constant term is Hermitian, will be inherited to a transformed discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation. Based on this inheritance property, an accelerated fixed-point iteration is proposed for finding the maximal solution via the transformed Riccati equation. Numerical examples are shown to illustrate the correctness of our theoretical results and the feasibility of the proposed algorithm."

The rank-2 case is special in the sense that while the problem is NP-hard for general $r$ and somewhat trivial in the case of $r=1$, the complexity of rank-2 NMF is not known. Furthermore, NMF-2 is equivalent to rank-2 optimization with a non-negativity constraint, which is not true for larger $r$.
NMF-2 is commonly approached by solving for the components $A$ and $B$ separately in an alternating fashion (ANLS). This means solving several independent nonnegative least squares problems, which can be done exactly with relatively low computational cost in the rank-2 case. The ANLS method is not guaranteed to converge to the global minimum, and choosing a good starting point is crucial. Specifically, the ANLS method often seems to converge to a trivial solution with a column of zeros when the starting point is chosen carelessly. 
We suggest using a certain angular coordinate representation of the matrices $A$ and $B$ and then optimizing over these new sets of coordinates.
This approach has the benefit of introducing only a few zeros, which is a good property for a starting point for ANLS.
The tests we have implemented suggest that our method gives a better approximation than other existing methods such as SPA \cite{gillis2014hierarchical} while maintaining the same level of computational complexity.
Ideally the method could be generalized for $r > 2$, but it is still under consideration how this could be done.

a generalization of the classical numerical range, namely $q$-numerical range was introduced by Marcus and Andresen in 1977 on $n$- dimensional unitary space. In 1984, the convexity of $q$-numerical range was proved by Nam-Kiu Tsing. The $q$-numerical range of $T \in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ is defined by 
\[
W_q(T)=\{ \langle Tx,y \rangle: x,y \in H, \|x\|=\|y\|=1, \langle x,y \rangle=q \}.

Initially, we established the convexity properties of the $q$-numerical range within semi-Hilbertian space, followed by an examination of its relationship with the spectrum in the same context.

On the other hand, $d(\mathcal{K})$ is proved to be equal to the number of nonnegative eigenvalues of $(\mathcal{K}+\mathcal{K}^*)/2$. Alternative characterizations of $d(\mathcal{K})$ are given.

These $n$ points are embedded independently and with uniform probability as points $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ of the $d$-dimensional flat unit torus $\mathbf{T^d}$. A random graph $G$ is generated so that the edge $\{i,j\}$ appears with probability $F_{in}(||X_i-X_j||)$ if $i$ and $j$ belong to the same community, and with probability $F_{out}(||X_i-X_j||)$  if $i$ and $j$ belong to different communities.

When considering the iterative solution of large-scale matrix equations, the iterates are nevertheless low-rank matrices generated by a fixed-point process in which, in general, the mapping function changes at each iteration.
To enable acceleration of the iterative solution for such problems, we propose two novel generalizations of RRE.
First, we show how to effectively compute RRE for sequences of low-rank matrices.
Second, we derive a formulation of RRE that is suitable for fixed-point processes in which the mapping function changes at each iteration.

$\mathcal{A}(X)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^LA_kXB_k=C$ with $L>2$, where the linear operator $\mathcal{A}$ admits a convergent additive splitting. We discuss the incorporation of RRE in those iterations for small to moderately sized problems and
also in low-rank variants for large-scale problems [5].

","The efficient solution of large-scale multiterm linear matrix equations is a challenging task in numerical linear algebra, and it is a largely open problem. In this talk, a new iterative scheme for symmetric and positive definite operators is presented, significantly advancing methods such as truncated matrix-oriented Conjugate Gradients (CG). The new algorithm capitalizes on the low-rank matrix format of its iterates by fully exploiting the subspace information of the factors as iterations proceed. The approach implicitly relies on orthogonality conditions imposed over much larger subspaces than in CG, unveiling insightful connections with subspace projection methods. The new method is also equipped with memory-saving strategies. In particular, for a given matrix $Y$, the action $\mathcal{L}(Y)$ in low rank format may not be evaluated exactly due to memory constraints. This problem is often underestimated, though it will eventually produce Out-of-Memory breakdowns for a sufficiently large number of terms. We propose an ad-hoc randomized range-finding strategy that appears to fully resolve this shortcoming. Experimental results with typical application problems illustrate the potential of our approach over various methods developed in the recent literature.

","An almost $k$-cover of the hypercube $Q^n = \{0,1\}^n$ is a collection of hyperplanes that avoids the origin and covers every other vertex at least $k$ times. When $k$ is large with respect to the dimension $n$, Clifton and Huang asymptotically determined the minimum possible size of an almost $k$-cover. Central to their proof was an extension of the LYM inequality, concerning a weighted count of hyperplanes. In this paper we completely characterise the hyperplanes of maximum weight, showing that there are $\binom{2n-1}{n}$ such hyperplanes. We further provide stability, bounding the weight of all hyperplanes that are not of maximum weight. These results allow us to effectively shrink the search space when using integer linear programming to construct small covers, and as a result we are able to determine the exact minimum size of an almost $k$-cover of $Q^6$ for most values of $k$. We further use the stability result to improve the Clifton--Huang lower bound for infinitely many choices of $k$ in every sufficiently large dimension $n$.

Every difference set gives rise to a symmetric balanced incomplete block design.

In 1933, R. Paley characterized when a set of squares forms a difference set. Later, S. Chowla extended this result to fourth powers. A difference set formed by $\ell$-th powers is called a power difference set. A natural question is whether all $\ell$-th power difference sets can be characterized. However, so far, researchers have only been able to construct such sets for $\ell = 2, 4, 8$ when $\ell \leq 24$, and it is conjectured that no other power difference sets exist.

Cyclotomic numbers captures the sizes of certain subsets intersections in a finite field. These numbers provide crucial information about the existence of a power difference set. The cyclotomic matrix is a matrix whose entries are cyclotomic numbers. By exploring properties of the cyclotomic matrix, we are able to conclude that if a power difference set exists, and if the size of elements outside the set is a square, then $\ell$ is congruent to $0$ or $2$ modulo $8$. This result holds for a power difference set that forms a finite projective plane. In contrast, our result allows for discussing an infinite number of $\ell$ values, extending the scope of previous finite cases. As far as we know, this may be the first application of cyclotomic matrices to power difference sets.

The coefficient matrix is assumed to be symmetric positive definite and spectrally equivalent to an average matrix for all parameters in a given set. We develop a Ritz method for rapidly approximating the eigenvalues on the spectral interval of interest $(0,\Lambda)$ for given parameter value. The Ritz subspace is the same for all parameters and it is designed based on the observation that any eigenvector can be split into two components. The first component belongs to a subspace spanned by some eigenvectors of the average matrix. The second component is defined by a correction operator that is a $d+1$ dimensional analytic function. We use this structure and build our Ritz subspace from eigenvectors of the average matrix and samples of the correction operator. The samples are evaluated at interpolation points related to a sparse polynomial interpolation method. We show that the resulting Ritz subspace can approximate eigenvectors of the original problem related to the spectral interval of interest with the same accuracy as the sparse polynomial interpolation approximates the correction operator. Bound for Ritz eigenvalue error follows from this and known results. Theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples. The advantage of our approach is that the analysis treats multiple eigenvalues and eigenvalue crossings that typically have posed technical challenges in similar works.

As it takes place in the Arnoldi process, it produces an orthonormal basis for \({\mathcal L}_k + A {\mathcal L}_k\), where the basis for \({\mathcal L}_k\) is formed by its first \(\dim {\mathcal L}_k\) vectors. Moreover, the basis for \({\mathcal L}_i\) is represented using the first \(\dim {\mathcal L}_i\) vectors of the basis for \({\mathcal L}_k\), for all \(i = \overline{1 \dots k}\). This enhancement enables a universal GMRES extension, where ${\mathcal L}_k$ and $A{\mathcal L}_k$ greatly coincide.  The extension is suitable for systems with multiple right-hand sides, allowing dynamic block size changes and on-the-fly integration of new right-hand sides. It also supports deflated restarts with any selected deflation strategy and a flexible preconditioner. Since all essential bases are compactly represented within a common basis, memory and computational demands are minimal relative to constructing the common basis.

% The GMRES method for solving linear systems $Ax=b$, $A \in \C^{N \times N}$, $b \in \C^{N}$ effectively implements the idea of approximating the solution in a Krylov subspace $\K_k$ through minimizing  the current residual over the subspace $A\K_k$. It is done through construction of the common basis of $\K_k+ A\K_k = \K_{k+1}$ with the Arnoldi process.
% Meanwhile, a variety of GMRES extensions(flexible, deflated versions) use search spaces $\L_k$ that  do not constitute a Krylov subspace. However, $\Dim \L_k$ + $\Dim A\L_k$ exceeds greatly $\Dim (\L_k + A\L_k)$. For this reason we developed a mechanism that constructs the common basis of $A\L_k + \L_k$ for a general case of $\L_k$. With this, we developed the GMRES method extension with the following properties: (1) flexible preconditioning can be applied, (2)  different deflation strategies for restarting can be implemented effectively with the common basis, (3) systems with multiple right-hand sides $Ax^{(s)} = b^{(s)}$, $b \in \C^{N}$, $s=\overline{1, M}$ can be solved one-by one, (4) systems with multiple right-hand sides can be solved

$$
{\rm erf}(A) := \frac{2A}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{0}^{1} e^{-(Av)^{2}} dv \quad \text{and} \quad {\rm erfc}(A) := \frac{2A}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{1}^{\infty} e^{-(Av)^{2}} dv,
$$
respectively. 

One of the most important application of the complimentary error matrix function is the solution to systems of partial differential equation. 
Let $u_0, u(x,t) \in \mathbf{C}^n$. 
It is proven in \cite{Cortes} that the solution to semi-finite coupled diffusion problem 
\begin{eqnarray*}
u_{t} &=& A^2u_{xx}, \ x>0, \ t>0, \\
u(x,0) &=& 0, \ x>0, \quad 
u(0,t) = u_{0}, \ t>0, \quad 
u(x,t) \to 0, \ \textrm{as} \ x\rightarrow\infty, \ t > 0
\end{eqnarray*}
can be represented by using the complimentary error matrix function as follows:
$$
u(x,t) = {\rm erfc}\left(\frac{A^{-1}x}{2\sqrt{t}}\right)u_{0}, \quad x>0, \quad t>0. 
$$

Analogously to the scaler case, the functions ${\rm erf}(A)$ and ${\rm erfc}(A)$ satisfy the property ${\rm erf}(A) + {\rm erfc}(A) = I$, where $I$ is the $n \times n$ identity matrix. 
According to the Taylor expansion of $e^{-(Av)^{2}}$ where $v \in [0,1]$, and integrating term by term, we obtain 
$$
{\rm erf}(A) = \frac{2A}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^k A^{2k}}{k! (2k+1)}, 
$$
which is the Taylor expansion of ${\rm erf}(A)$ \cite{Cortes}. 
From this expansion and ${\rm erf}(A) + {\rm erfc}(A) = I$, we obtain 
$$
{\rm erfc}(A) = I - \frac{2A}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^k A^{2k}}{k! (2k+1)}. 
$$
In \cite{Cortes}, an upper bound on $\|{\rm erfc}(A)\|_2$ under the condition ${\rm Re}(\lambda) > |{\rm Im}(\lambda)|$, $\forall \lambda \in \sigma(A)$ has been derived as a corollary of the fact that ${\rm erfc}(A)$ is well-defined. 

The purpose of this talk is to present the following norm bounds: 
\begin{itemize}
\item a new upper bound on $\|{\rm erfc}(A)\|_2$ under a condition which is different from ${\rm Re}(\lambda) > |{\rm Im}(\lambda)|$, $\forall \lambda \in \sigma(A)$, 
\item upper bounds on $\|{\rm erf}(A) - {\rm erf}(B)\|_2$ and $\|{\rm erfc}(A) - {\rm erfc}(B)\|_2$, where $B \in \mathbf{C}^{n \times n}$, under an assumption, and 
\item upper bounds on 
$$
\left\|{\rm erf}(A) - \frac{2A}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sum_{k=0}^{m}\frac{(-1)^k A^{2k}}{k! (2k+1)}\right\|_2 \ \text{and} \ 
\left\|{\rm erfc}(A) - \left(I - \frac{2A}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sum_{k=0}^{m}\frac{(-1)^kA^{2k}}{k!(2k+1)}\right)\right\|_2,
$$ 
where $m$ is a nonnegative integer, under an assumption. 
\end{itemize}
We report results of numerical experiments in order to observe how much larger the presented bounds are compared to the corresponding norms.

Such edge modes are the eigenmodes of the PDE operator for a joint optical structure formed by connecting together two photonic crystals with distinct topological invariants, and the corresponding eigenfrequencies are located in the shared band gap of two individual photonic crystals. This work is concerned with maximizing the shared band gap of two photonic crystals with different topological features in order to increase the bandwidth of the edge modes. We develop a semi-definite optimization framework for the underlying optimal design problem, which enables efficient update of dielectric functions at each time step while respecting symmetry constraints and, when necessary, the constraints on topological invariants. At each iteration, we perform sensitivity analysis 
of the band gap function and the topological invariant constraint function to linearize the optimization problem and solve a convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problem efficiently. Numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm is superior in generating optimized optical structures with robust edge modes.

\begin{equation*}
{\mathcal{P}}_{n}=\{p \in {{\mathbb{R}}}[x]: p(A)\geq 0 \text{ for all }  A \geq 0, A \in {\mathbb{R}}^{n,n}\}.
\end{equation*}
${\mathcal{P}}_{n}$ was defined by Loewy and London, motivated by the Nonnegative Inverse Eigenvalue Problem (NIEP), but is of independent interest. Clearly, ${\mathcal{P}}_{n}$ is a closed, convex cone.

\medskip
Given any polynomial $p$, we identify $p$ with its sequence of coefficients. In order to consider only finite dimensional vector spaces, we restrict the degree of the polynomials. Given a positive integer $m$, define

\begin{equation*}
{\mathcal{P}}_{n,m}=\{p \in {\mathcal{P}}_{n} : degree(p) \leq m \}.
\end{equation*}
Then, ${\mathcal{P}}_{n,m}$ can be thought as a cone in ${\mathbb{R}}^{m+1}$.

\medskip
It is clear that any polynomial with nonnegative coefficients is in ${\mathcal{P}}_{n}$. Therefore, the number, relative size and distribution of the negative coefficients of polynomials in ${\mathcal{P}}_{n}$ are of significant interest. Clark and Paparella showed that if $p \in {\mathcal{P}}_{n}$, then its first and last $n$ coefficients must be nonnegative. Hence, ${\mathcal{P}}_{n,m}$ is a simplicial cone, for any $0 < m <2n$.

\medskip
Let $m \geq 2n$. Then, ${\mathcal{P}}_{n,m}$ contains polynomials with negative coefficients. For example, there exists $a > 0$ such that $1+x+x^{2}+\cdots+x^{n-1}-ax^{n}+x^{n+1}+\cdots+x^{2n} \in {\mathcal{P}}_{n,2n}$ (the question of the optimal $a$ is of interest).
It follows that the structure of ${\mathcal{P}}_{n,m}$ is nontrivial. We consider its face structure, and in particular the one dimensional faces, that is, the extreme rays. Using some information on the possible coefficients of polynomials in  ${\mathcal{P}}_{n,m}$, we show that  ${\mathcal{P}}_{n,m}$ is not polyhedral, that is, contains infinitely many extreme rays. Additional preliminary results on the faces are obtained."

In high-dimensional problems, computing and storing this inverse Hessian may be intractable while low-rank approximations may be poor in ill-conditioned settings. We show that in 4DVar problems, we can construct effective preconditioners using what we know about the scales of different sources of uncertainty – such as such as model, background, and measurement errors. When this is used in combination with the quasi-Newton method l-BFGS, we can greatly speed up the optimization and improve the approximation of posterior covariance. Moreover, the form of this approximation in terms of the symmetric low-rank updates, gives a way to factorize the covariance matrix and efficiently sample from the posterior distribution.

","In Bayesian inverse problems, it is common to consider several hyperparameters that define the prior and the noise model that must be estimated from the data. In particular, we are interested in linear inverse problems with additive Gaussian noise and Gaussian priors defined using Matérn covariance models. In this case, we estimate the hyperparameters using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the marginalized posterior distribution. However, this is a computationally intensive task since it involves computing log determinants. To address this challenge, we consider a stochastic average approximation (SAA) of the objective function and use the preconditioned Lanczos method to compute efficient approximations of the function and gradient evaluations. We propose a new preconditioner that can be updated cheaply for new values of the hyperparameters and an approach to compute approximations of the gradient evaluations, by reutilizing information from the function evaluations. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on static and dynamic seismic tomography problems.

Although a key quantum feature, it is unclear whether complementarity can be understood more operationally, as a necessary resource in some quantum information task. Here we show this is the case, and relates to a novel task which we term {\em $\eta$-unambiguous exclusion}.

these methods are typically based on semi-definite low-rank factorizations of
their solutions and consider the classical CARE formulation

While extensive research has been conducted on the Greatest Common Divisors (GCDs) of scalar polynomials, the study of GCRDs in polynomial matrices remains relatively limited. It is important to develop fast and reliable ways to compute both exact and approximate GCRD, especially when dealing with approximate cases where the data is corrupted by noise.\\
We address the problem of computing both exact and approximate GCRDs for a given set of univariate polynomial matrices $B_1(s), \dots, B_t(s)$. We establish a key theoretical result—proving that the rank deficiency of a particular generalized Sylvester matrix associated with $P(s)$, where $P(s)$ is obtained by stacking $B_1(s), \dots, B_t(s)$ one below the other, corresponds to the degree of the determinant of their GCRD. This equivalence enables us to develop efficient algorithms for computing an exact GCRD using \textit{Effectively Eliminating QR} (EEQR) decomposition and $SVD$ of that particular generalized Sylvester matrix. $SVD$ can handle noise-corrupted data, making it particularly effective for computing an approximate GCRD. This approach leverages the numerical rank of that particular generalized Sylvester matrix to estimate the degree of an approximate GCRD. Both algorithms are simple to develop, easy to understand, and convenient to implement, ensuring scalability.\\

This problem extends the classical task of finding the nearest non-coprime polynomials to a set of coprime polynomials. Our approach begins by establishing the equivalence between the left-primeness property of a polynomial matrix and the rank deficiency of a specific block Toeplitz matrix derived from the polynomial matrix. By leveraging this equivalence, we reformulate the problem as finding the nearest Structured Low-Rank Approximation (SLRA) to the associated block Toeplitz matrix, with a particular focus on cases where the leading coefficient matrix of the left-prime polynomial matrix has full row rank.

We further generalize the problem to compute a non-prime matrix that is as close as possible to a given left-prime polynomial matrix while preserving a predefined structural form. In this setting, the problem is again recast as computing the nearest SLRA of a structured matrix in case of full rank leading coefficient matrix. For computing SLRA, we employ numerical techniques such as the STLN method and regularized factorization, both of which are well-documented in the literature.

Additionally, we prove that it is possible to approximate a left-prime polynomial matrix with a rank-deficient leading coefficient matrix by a non-prime polynomial matrix, without adhering to the underlying structure. For cases involving structured coefficient matrices, we reformulate the problem as a constrained optimization task. By applying numerical optimization methods, we solve this optimization problem effectively.

Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm with several numerical examples and compare the results with existing approaches in the literature wherever possible."

Algorithms for finding an upper bound of this distance have been obtained in the literature. In this talk we will present upper and lower bounds on the distance to \emph{bounded realness} which are often seen to be tight in numerical experiments. In fact in many cases the bounds are seen to be equal. We identify conditions under which the equality holds. In particular, we show that our algorithm computes the distance if the Hamiltonian matrix $H$ has only purely imaginary eigenvalues with the ones of positive type being separated from those of negative type. The key to obtaining the results is to convert the Hamiltonian matrix eigenvalue problem into that of an eigenvalue problem associated with a closely related Hermitian matrix pencil.

In several frameworks, we may be interested in the numerical approximation of a prescribed subset of eigenvectors, possibly coming from a good approximation of part of the eigenspace. This extraction of eigenpairs from a subspace can be done employing a class of methods often called oblique projectors. They consist in solving a different generalized eigenvalue problem $P^TAQv = \lambda P^T B Qv$, for suitable $P,Q\in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and $n<m$. A popular example of oblique projectors is Rayleigh-Ritz. However, it can be observed that this method is not backward stable. The goal of this talk consists in proposing alternative methods within the family of oblique projectors, with the additional property of being backward stable. Moreover, in settings where $m \gg n$, we present a randomized version of this technique, obtained via the solution a sketched version of the generalized eigenvalue problem.

It is an important problem in Matrix Theory.
Completion problems of matrices frequently arise in applications, for instance in structural changes of the dynamics of a system or in pole placement problems in control  theory. They also appear in solutions of perturbation problems. 
This work is devoted to the row completion problem for polynomial and rational matrices. 
We characterize the existence of a polynomial matrix when its complete structural data  (the invariant factors, the invariants orders at infinity, and the column and row minimal indices) and some of its rows are prescribed, allowing the completed matrix to increase the degree.
The same problem is solved for rational matrices.
We have also  solved the corresponding problem of partial prescription of the complete structural data covering  all of the possibilities. We will show here some cases.
Obviously, the results obtained hold for the corresponding column  completion problems.

In the case of graph theory, solutions to problems are often subsets of the vertex set with a specific property. We refer to these as vertex set parameters. In this talk I will share a universal approach to vertex set parameter reconfiguration developed with Leslie Hogben and Bryan Curtis that is applied to zero forcing variants as well as other common graph parameters. Zero forcing was developed in this community to be an upper bound to the nullity of any real symmetric matrix with off-diagonal zero pattern determined by the adjacency matrix of a given graph. Understanding zero forcing sets has applications to understanding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices. 
Reconfiguration is also a description of how Leslie Hogben has helped to change our community for the better, one step at a time by facilitating community and research opportunity to graduate students, new researchers and faculty at undergraduate institutions. I will share my perspective on her reconfiguration efforts.

Zero forcing is a propagation process on a network whereby some nodes are initially blue with all others white. Blue vertices can ``force'' a white neighbor to become blue if all other  neighbors are blue. The goal is to find the minimum number of initially blue vertices to eventually force all vertices blue after exhaustively applying the forcing rule above.
Leaky forcing is a fault-tolerant variation of zero forcing where certain vertices (not necessarily initially blue) cannot force. The goal in this context is to find the minimum number of initially blue vertices needed that can eventually force all vertices to be blue, {\it regardless} of which small number of vertices can't force.

This work extends results from zero forcing in terms of leaky forcing. New results regarding leaky forcing presented here include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete determination of all leaky forcing numbers for all unicyclic graphs.
\item Robust upper bounds for generalized Petersen graphs.
\item Bounds for the effect of both edge removal and vertex removal.
\item A complete characterization for which connected graphs have the maximum possible $1$-leaky forcing number (i.e., when $Z_{(1)}(G) = |V(G)|-1$).

For a fixed $t_0>0$, an index $p \in [n]:={1,2,\ldots,n}$ is called a winner for $t_0$ if the spectral radius $\rho(A+t_0E_{pp})=\max\limits_{i\in [n]}\rho(A+t_0E_{ii})$. If $p$ remains a winner for each $t>0$, then it is called a universal winner. The concepts have been introduced in 1996 and studied in only a few articles till now. When $G$ is a simple connected graph (or a strongly connected digraph), the nonnegative weighted adjacency matrix $A(G)$ being irreducible, one can talk of a universal winner vertex with respect to $A(G)$. The universal winners seem to capture the graph structures well. It is known that the only connected digraph $G$ in which all vertices are universal winners with respect to all nonnegative weighted $A(G)$, is the directed cycle, thereby characterizing it. Let $U\subset [n]$ be nonempty. In a recent article, the class of directed connected graphs with vertex set $[n]$, for which only the vertices in $U$ are the universal winners with respect to all nonnegative weighted $A(G)$ was characterized, generalizing the earlier result. Many other combinatorial results exploiting the graph structure were proved establishing the importance of the study of universal winner vertices. In this article, we further the study for the class of undirected graphs, in particular for trees, with respect to only the adjacency matrix. As expected, we supply a class of trees in which no universal winner exists. More interestingly, every tree is a subtree of a tree with a unique universal winner and also a subtree of a tree without a universal winner. Trees with exactly $k>1$ universal winners are not easy to find. A construction of a class of trees with exactly $k$ universal winners is provided. Interestingly, it turns out that for any undirected connected graph $G$, the set of universal winners of $G$ and the corona $G\circ K_1$ are the same, where the later is obtained by adding a new pendent vertex to each vertex of $G$. It is also shown that if $\rho(A(G))>2$, then no vertex of degree one or two can be a universal winner. Previously, it was known that for a path $P$, the central vertices are the universal winners and as a vertex $u$ goes farther from the center, the spectral radius $\rho(A(P)+tE_{uu})$ decreases. We prove that a similar statement also holds for a grid graph."

","In a Euclidean Jordan algebra $\mathcal{V}$, a spectral function $G : \mathcal{V} \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined as a function that depends solely on the eigenvalues of its argument. Formally, such a function takes the form $G = f \circ \lambda$, where $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is a (symmetric) function and $\lambda : \mathcal{V} \to \mathbb{R}^n$ denotes the eigenvalue mapping. It turns out that spectral functions are invariant under algebra automorphisms of $\mathcal{V}$.
Due to their simple yet elegant structure and wide applicability, spectral functions play a crucial role not only in matrix theory but also in convex analysis, optimization, and beyond. It has been observed that $G$ is (strictly) convex if and only if so is the associated function $f$, which we call a transfer principle for (strict) convexity. In this talk, we will explore analogous transfer principle for generalized notions of convexity, including strong convexity, quasi-convexity, pseudo-convexity, and related concepts.

However, the methods often exhibit large oscillations in the residual and approximation norms. The large oscillations are known to lead to a large increase in the residual gap (the difference between the recursively updated residual and the explicitly computed residual) due to rounding errors. The cross-interactive residual smoothing (CIRS) is a useful scheme to improve convergence behavior and the residual gap for a single right-hand side case. This approach ensures that the primary and smoothed sequences of residuals influence one another, thereby avoiding the severe propagation of rounding errors. In our previous study, we have extended CIRS to the global version that can be applicable to linear matrix equations. In this study, we propose another extension to the multiple right-hand sides case; that is, a block version of CIRS (Bl-CIRS). Subsequently, we demonstrate its effectiveness through a rounding error analysis and numerical experiments. We show that orthonormalizing the columns of direction matrices in Bl-CIRS is crucial to reduce the residual gap.

The relation between the classical Krylov subspace methods and their $\star$-counterparts can be used as a way to compute the solution of ODEs by the $\star$-algebra approach and, vice versa, to analyze classical Krylov subspace methods for time-dependent matrices with possible applications to perturbed matrices.

The theory of classical orthogonal polynomials and matrix analysis naturally arises in the study of tridiagonal matrices (Jacobi matrices), whose spectrum, under certain conditions, coincides with the support of a measure associated with a sequence of orthogonal polynomials. Furthermore, the GaussâBorel factorization of the moment matrix plays a fundamental role in characterizing orthogonality and uncovering key structural properties. \\
We focus on MMOP, which are orthogonal polynomials with respect to a matrix of measures. In this case, the associated Jacobi matrix is a banded matrix, where the number of nonzero diagonals depends on the size of the measure. Within this framework, we study how orthogonal polynomials transform when the matrix of measures undergoes matrix polynomial perturbations. The most general perturbation we consider follows Uvarovâs form:   \\
    $ \mathrm{d}\tilde{\mu}(x) R(x) = L(x) \mathrm{d} \mu(x),$\\
where $R(x),\,L(x)$ are polynomial matrices, $\mathrm{d} \mu (x)$ is the original measure matrix, and $\mathrm{d} \tilde{\mu}(x)$ is the perturbed measure matrix. By taking $R(x) = I$ or $L(x) = I$, we obtain a Christoffel or Geronimus perturbation, respectively.   \\
The main contribution of our work is the generalization of these perturbations beyond diagonal matrix polynomials, extending the theory to include cases with non-monic leading matrices. This generalization leads to an analysis of the spectral properties of the perturbation matrix polynomials. Furthermore, we reduce the problem of ensuring orthogonalityâframed as a question of the quasi-definiteness of a matrix measureâto a linear algebra problem involving the compatibility of certain systems of linear equations."

The number of matrices for which these properties may be expressed analytically is surprisingly small. The main purpose of studying these matrix classes is to provide test matrices for evaluating the accuracy and efficiency of computational processes. These matrix classes have the advantage that they may be chosen of arbitrary order, and by appropriately selecting their elements they may be made singular or nonsingular as desired in specific instances. This enables, for instance, to draw conclusions on the efficacy of new numerical methods by comparing computed inverses (or the Moore-Penrose inverses, as the case may be) with the known exact expressions for the inverse (or the Moore-Penrose inverse), and other such processes, that may be necessary in the application problems that motivate such considerations. In this talk we propose another extension of these test matrices including some of the more recent generalizations. Specifically, we are considering those invertible matrices whose inverses are what we refer to as {\it bi-diagonal ramp matrices}. We use such matrices to identify some new classes of inverse $Z$-matrices. Time permitting, a graph theoretic interpretation will also be presented.

We construct a rational orthogonal wavelet system that generates the levels of the multiresolution.

We can approximate any $f \in A_{\alpha}^{2} (\mathbb{D})$ by the projection operator on the $n^{\text{th}}$ resolution level. The projection will be an interpolation operator and whose coefficients can be computed through the evaluation of $f$ on a given set of points in the unit disc.

The transition matrix of $\Gamma$, denoted $H(t)$, is defined as $H(t) := \exp(-\textbf{i}tA)$, where $t \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\textbf{i} := \sqrt{-1}$. The graph $\Gamma$ exhibits pretty good fractional revival (PGFR) between the vertices $a$ and $b$ if there exists a sequence $\{t_k\}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $\lim_{k\to\infty} H(t_k){\textbf{e}_{a}} = \alpha{\textbf{e}_{a}} + \beta{\textbf{e}_{b}}$, where $\alpha, \beta(\neq 0) \in \mathbb{C}$ with $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$. In particular, if $\alpha = 0$, then $\Gamma$ exhibits pretty good state transfer (PGST) between $a$ and $b$. In this study, we first present a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of PGFR on Cayley graphs over abelian groups. Using that necessary and sufficient condition, we prove that complement of a cycle on $2 p^s$ vertices, where $p$ is an odd prime and $s$ is a positive integer, exhibits PGFR.  In the class of unitary Cayley graphs, we prove that an unitary Cayley graph on $n$ ($n \geq 8$) vertices exhibits PGFR if and only if $n = 2p$, where $p$ is an odd prime. The preceding two classes of circulant graphs provide infinitely many circulant graphs exhibiting PGFR that fails to exhibits PGST. Further we obtain more circulant graphs exhibiting PGFR. We also obtain some classes of circulant graphs not exhibiting PGFR. Some of our results generalize the results of Chan et al.

chosen to drive the process toward convergence. The most common choice is the
Wilkinson shift for~$m=1$ or~$2$. Rayleigh quotient shifts dominate when
multiple shifts $m\gg 1$ are used. We present alternatives to the Rayleigh
quotient and the Wilkinson shift for the single or double shift case. We present
novel shift strategies for QR algorithms and generalize them to pole-swapping
algorithms.

For normal matrices the Wilkinson shift is proven globally convergent locally
with a cubic convergence rate. The local convergence rate is based on the cubic
convergence of the Rayleigh quotient iteration. Usually for non-normal matrices
locally only a quadratic convergence rate is observed both in Francis's QR
algorithm and in Rayleigh quotient iteration.

It has been shown by Ostrowski in 1959 that the two-sided Rayleigh quotient
iteration is cubic convergent also for non-normal matrices.  We aim to improved
the shift strategy for non-normal matrices by incorporating ideas from the
two-sided Rayleigh quotient following ideas by Chen and Xu. The two-sided
Rayleigh quotient requires an approximation to the right eigenvector, which is
expensive to compute. Hence, we focus on a heuristic approximation to the right
eigenvector.

The discussions also apply to derivatives of Francis's algorithm like the QZ
algorithm by Moler and Stewart, the core-chasing, and the pole-swapping
variants.

We present extensive numerical experiments comparing the different shift
strategies. These provide valuable insights for practical implementations since
the typical number of iterations to reach machine precision is far more
important than the convergence rate at infinity.

Accurate correlation matrices are essential for effective risk management and investment strategies.  
The NCM problem is mathematically formulated as a constrained optimization problem, often solved using the alternating projection method (APM) or alternating direction of multipliers method (ADMM) . However, its slow linear convergence and required complete eigenvalue decomposition at each iteration render it computationally expensive and impractical for large-scale problems. Alternatively, the NCM problem can be reformulated as an unconstrained optimization task in its dual form, taking advantage of its convex structure. It allows for a focus on minimizing the dual objective function by solving for the zeros of its gradient to satisfy first-order optimality conditions. Our proposed method belongs to the framework of the generalized linesearch iterative methods, incorporating two basic elements: search direction and stepsize determination. Additionally, we introduce two practical mechanisms, including an accelerated step and nonlinear preconditioning, to improve the method's robustness and efficiency.
We proposed the quasi-Newton method with diagonal Jacobian approximation (QN-SDAJ), which is used as a nonlinear preconditioner to accelerate gradient descent, significantly reducing the number of iterations and computational time. Numerical results show that our proposed method outperforms existing alternatives, including accelerated gradient descent, semismooth inexact Newton, and APM, particularly for large-scale problems, demonstrating superior efficiency."

The SDC method constructs numerical methods of arbitrary order by iteratively applying a lower-order method to an error function,
enabling significant reductions in computational cost while maintaining strong stability properties.
For first-order ODE problems, many theoretical and numerical results for SDC are available.
However, for fractional differential equations (FDEs), although there are many numerical results, only a few theoretical studies can be found.
FDEs can be considered a generalization of ODEs, replacing integer orders with non-integer ones.
Since FDEs can describe many natural and artificial phenomena, they have attracted increasing attention in recent years.
In this talk, we will apply a two-grid SDC method to multi-order FDEs and present an analysis of their stability and convergence.
Numerical experiments are included to illustrate the theoretical results.

Let $w(G)$ denote the image of this map. In recent times, it emerged as one of the potential research areas, and produced several astonishing results. Though it has a long history dating back to A. Borel, it has attracted a significant amount of attention, especially after the settlement of the long-standing Ore’s conjecture (which states that every element of a finite non-abelian simple group is a commutator). Note that if $G$ is a field, this is nothing else than a linear form with integer coefficients in $r$ variables. Thus the study of $w(G)$ can be thought of as finding solutions to equations in objects belonging to the category of groups. For non-abelian $G$, word maps are more subtle objects and a lot of effort has been required to unravel some of their properties. Fix an integer $k\geq 2$ and consider the word $x^k\in F_1$. The corresponding word map is called a power map and it has been studied for several decades in various contexts. A remarkable result by McCrudden connects the power map with the exponential map. McCrudden's result states that, for a connected Lie group $G$, $g\in G$ has roots of all orders if and only if $g$ is contained in a one-parameter subgroup (and hence $g=\exp(X)$). In this talk, we will discuss the analogous result for a linear algebraic group over non-Archimedean local field $F$ with any characteristic.  We discuss our recent result about when an element $g\in G(F)\subset GL(V)$ admits roots of all orders? Also, we will discuss the above theme in the context of linear algebraic groups over global fields.

Weaving phase and norm retrieval sequences for a Hilbert space were recently studied by Dowerah et al. In this paper we study weaving phase and weaving norm retrieval sequences in the tensor product of Hilbert spaces defined by Folland, in the year 1995, as a space of bounded antilinear maps between Hilbert spaces. Several characterizations and methods of construction of weaving phase and norm retrieval sequences in tensor product spaces are discussed.

We show that this compression is best possible for matrix algebras over finite fields. We consider the compressed commuting graphs of finite fields, rings of $2 \times 2$ matrices over finite fields and rings of $3 \times 3$ matrices over finite prime fields.

This method serves as the primary tool for locally approximating functions that cannot be expressed solely through basic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—using polynomials.
To grasp the significance of this mathematical concept, historical and epistemological research is essential, as noted by Sierpinska $[1]$. The notion of expansion has evolved through several stages, reflecting the development of a broad conceptual framework. R. Kouki $[2]$ categorizes these stages into five non-linear steps, which incorporate various geometric, analytical, and algebraic techniques. The groundwork for this work was laid in the early seventeenth century by mathematicians such as Torricelli, Roberval, Fermat, Descartes, and Isaac Barrow, who addressed tangent problems. This was further articulated by Taylor in 1715 and later expanded upon by Newton and Leibniz through polynomial methods, with significant contributions from Cauchy in 1823 and Abel in 1826, culminating in Poincar\'e's work in 1886.
Today, calculating the expansion of a function often requires divisions based on increasing powers, where approximate reasoning involves neglecting certain terms in this limiting process. In this context, we propose a novel algorithmic matrix technique that leverages the fundamental properties of matrix computations. Specifically, we associate the expansion of a function $f$ to order $n$ near zero with a Toeplitz triangular matrix, where the first column represents the polynomial corresponding to the expansion of $f$. We then outline all calculation rules for these limited developments. Ultimately, our work gives a quick algorithm to find, according to Douady $[3]$ the object ``the expansion'' of non-usual functions, whose Toeplitz matrices we have chosen as a ``tool'' and vice
versa in some cases. This approach highlights the importance of matrix techniques in advancing our understanding and application of function expansions.

Given a set of input-output pairs of an unknown function defined on a tropical semifield, the problem is to determine an approximating rational function formed by two Puiseux polynomials as numerator and denominator in the function. With specified numbers of monomials in both polynomials, the approximation aims at evaluating the exponent and coefficient for each monomial in the polynomials to fit the rational function to the given data in the sense of a tropical distance function. To solve the problem, we transform it into approximation of a vector equation with unknown vectors on both sides with one side answered to the numerator polynomial and the other side to the denominator. Each side of the equation involves a matrix with entries dependent on the unknown exponents, multiplied by the vector of unknown coefficients of monomials in the corresponding polynomial. We propose an algorithm that constructs a series of approximate solutions by alternatively fixing one side of the equation to the already found result and leaving the other intact. The obtained equation is first approximated with respect to the vector of coefficients, which results in a vector of coefficients and approximation error both parameterized by the exponents. Furthermore, the values of exponents are found by minimization of the approximation error, using an optimization procedure that is based on an agglomerative clustering technique. To illustrate applications, we present results for approximation problems formulated in terms of max-plus algebra (a real semifield with addition defined as maximum and multiplication as arithmetic addition), which correspond to ordinary problems of piecewise linear approximation of real functions. As our numerical experience shows, the proposed algorithm converges in a finite number of steps and provides a reasonably good solution to approximation problems considered.

Two cones $K_1$ and $K_2$ are said to be isomorphic if there exists an invertible linear map $L:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ such that  $L(K_1)=K_2$. For a cone $K$, the complementarity set is defined as $C(K)=\{(x,a)|x\in K, a\in K^*,\langle x,a \rangle=0\}$. A linear transformation $L$ is said to be Lyapunov-like transformation on $K$ if $\langle L(x), a \rangle=0$, for all $(x,a)\in C(K)$.

The eccentricity of a vertex $u \in G$, $(e(u))$, is defined as the maximum distance from $u$ to any other vertex $v \in G$ in the graph. The eccentricity matrix, $\epsilon(G)$ is derived from the distance matrix whose $(u, v)$-th entry is equal to $d(u, v)$ if $d(u, v)$ is the minimum of $\{e(u), e(v)\}$, and is zero otherwise. Note that $d(u, v)$ is the distance between the vertices $u$ and $v$. A graph $G$ is said to be self centered if the eccentricity of each vertex of $G$ is same. 

The corona product is a prominent graph operation known for its distinct structural features and has been the focus of extensive research. Over the time, several variations of the corona product have been introduced and analyzed.

Assume that $G$ and $H$ are two finite graphs on $m$ and $n$ vertices, respectively. The corona product $G \circ H$ of two graphs $G$ and $H$, is constructed by keeping a single copy of $G$ and $m$ copies of $H$, and then connecting each vertex of the $j$-th copy of $H$ to the $j$-th vertex of $G$. The one-point-corona, denoted as $G \circ_z H$, is constructed similarly by taking one copy of $H$ for each vertex of $G$, but only the the root vertex $z$ from each copy of $H$ is connected to corresponding vertex in $G$ with an edge.

In this talk, we discuss the irreducibility and spectra of eccentricity matrices obtained from the  corona product and the one point corona product of graphs $G$ and $H$, where $G$ is a self-centered graph."
